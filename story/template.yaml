        - hansel
        - henry
        - james
     location_mode: fixed
     location: living_room
     story_beat: All the kids play happily with their favorite toys around the Christmas
        tree in a warm, bustling living room.

   # page 03
   - id: p03
     index: 3
     section: Ordinary World
     page_type: individual
     characters: [main_character]
     location_mode: fixed
     location: living_room
     story_beat: The main character plays with their favorite toy, but something
        about the tree catches their attention—an ornament seems to be watching
        them specifically, singling them out. A chill runs through them.
     notes: Build anticipation. The haunting should feel personal and targeted,
        not random. The character should feel singled out from the others.

   # page 04
   - id: p04
     index: 4
     section: Ordinary World
     page_type: individual
     characters: [main_character]
     location_mode: fixed
     location: hallway
     story_beat: The main character follows a strange pull toward another part of
        the house. The hallway feels wrong—shadows lean away, sounds echo strangely,
        as if the house itself doesn't want them here.
     notes: Build dread. Foreshadow what's coming in the next room. The character
        should hear or sense something specific that hints at the challenge ahead.

   # page 05
   - id: p05
     index: 5
     section: First Attempt
     page_type: individual
     characters: [main_character]
     location_mode: by_role
     room_role: first_attempt
     story_beat: The main character steps into the room and realizes the haunting
        is targeting them personally. Something about this room is rejecting them,
        erasing them, making them feel like they don't belong. It's genuinely frightening.
     notes: Location depends on character's first attempt location (attempt_locations[0]).
        The horror should be emotional and personal—not just physical chaos. The
        character should feel attacked at their core identity.

   # page 06
   - id: p06
     index: 6
     section: First Attempt
     page_type: individual
     characters: [main_character]
     location_mode: by_role
     room_role: first_attempt
     story_beat: The haunting intensifies. Desperate, the character fights back with
        their most obvious skill—but while they achieve some surface success, the
        deeper horror continues. Their skill alone isn't enough.
     notes: The character's obvious talent (speed, strength, etc.) works partially
        but misses the point. The room keeps attacking them at a deeper level.

   # page 07
   - id: p07
     index: 7
     section: First Attempt
     page_type: individual
     characters: [main_character]
     location_mode: by_role
     room_role: first_attempt
     story_beat: The surface symptoms ease, but the character realizes they've only
        treated the symptoms, not the disease. The room still rejects them. They
        leave knowing their obvious skill wasn't the right tool—something deeper
        is needed.
     notes: 'First attempt: partial success only. Character should have a moment of
        realization that speed/strength/surface skills can''t solve emotional problems.'

   # page 08
   - id: p08
     index: 8
     section: Crossover / Pair
     page_type: pair
     characters: [main_character, pair_partner]
     location_mode: fixed
     location: hallway
     story_beat: The main character bumps into their room-swap partner in the hall,
        and they compare the strange things that just happened in their rooms.
     pair_groups:
        -    - arthur
             - cullan
        -    - james
             - hansel
        -    - emer
             - henry

   # page 09
   - id: p09
     index: 9
     section: Crossover / Pair
     page_type: pair
     characters: [main_character, pair_partner]
     location_mode: fixed
     location: hallway
     story_beat: They realize each other's strengths fit the other room better, decide
        the house is haunted, and agree to swap which room they will tackle next.
     pair_groups:
        -    - arthur
             - cullan
        -    - james
             - hansel
        -    - emer
             - henry

   # page 10
   - id: p10
     index: 10
     section: Second Attempt
     page_type: individual
     characters: [main_character]
     location_mode: fixed
     location: hallway
     story_beat: The character walks toward their second room with new understanding.
        From ahead, they hear something ominous—a hint of the horror waiting for them.
        But this time they know what they're truly capable of.
     notes: Build anticipation again. The character should hear or sense something
        specific and frightening from the room ahead.

   # page 11
   - id: p11
     index: 11
     section: Second Attempt
     page_type: individual
     characters: [main_character]
     location_mode: by_role
     room_role: second_attempt
     story_beat: In this room, the haunting attacks them in a new way—not erasing them,
        but making them the villain. Framing them. Accusing them. The room tries to
        twist their identity into something they're not.
     notes: The horror here should be about false accusation, being framed, being made
        into the bad guy. This is worse than being ignored—it's being blamed.

   # page 12
   - id: p12
     index: 12
     section: Second Attempt
     page_type: individual
     characters: [main_character]
     location_mode: by_role
     room_role: second_attempt
     story_beat: Instead of playing by the rigged rules, the character stops and
        speaks their truth with authority. They declare what is right, what is fair,
        what is true about themselves. The room begins to listen.
     notes: The solution is not physical but declarative. The character speaks with
        authority and the room has to obey. This is the discovery of real power.

   # page 13
   - id: p13
     index: 13
     section: Second Attempt
     page_type: individual
     characters: [main_character]
     location_mode: by_role
     room_role: second_attempt
     story_beat: The room yields completely. The accusations stop. The chaos bows to
        the character's authority. They stand in the peaceful space and realize they
        don't just sense what's right—they can command it. That's real power.
     notes: "Second attempt: this character is the 'room hero.' The payoff should be
        triumphant and deeply satisfying. Not just 'the room glows'—the room SUBMITS."

        sense that a larger wrongness is still pulsing through the house.

     location_mode: fixed

     story_beat: All the kids gather under the tree, sharing quick snapshots of what
        happened in their rooms, and realize everything traces back to the tree.

        attention to it.

        - regan
     location_mode: fixed
     location: living_room
     story_beat: Close-up on Regan's face as she recognizes it—shocked, worried, and
        surprised in a funny way. Behind her, rainbows, deities, lotuses, and other
        Buddhist imagery shimmer in the air as she realizes what the ornament contains.
        She identifies it as Dorje Legpa, a Gyalpo trickster deity whose nature is
        to scramble things.

        - james
     location_mode: fixed
     location: living_room
     story_beat: The ornament flares and the spirit erupts, growing huge and blazing
        red. The boys realize it's furious because it's cramped—too big for a bedroom,
        it needs sky!

   # page 20

     location_mode: fixed
     location: living_room
     story_beat: In a big action spread, each child uses their room-discovered superpower
        to contain the spirit. They tie it onto the bright red sled—still blazing
        and hilarious, complaining and wiggling. Very funny.

   # page 21

     location_mode: fixed
     location: driveway
     story_beat: Outside, Henry jumps into the toy airplane, which becomes the "vehicle
        of sky." James acts as air traffic controller on the ground—"Spirit Sled Three-Seven-Red,
        cleared for takeoff!"

   # page 22

     location_mode: fixed
     location: driveway
     story_beat: Cullan and Arthur ride in the sled being dragged by the airplane,
        holding the deity in a box. Emer trails behind on a tricycle with Hansel on
        the handlebars, pointing exultantly at the sky with his bottle. The plane
        lifts the sled—not too high, just enough for comedic effect—dragging it across
        the lawn, up over a little bump, maybe through some clouds.

     location_mode: fixed
     location: driveway
     story_beat: The moment the spirit is pulled into open space, it transforms—his
        flames soften into wind, his weapons turn into sparkles, his screaming face
        relaxes. He remembers he's not a monster but a sky guardian who forgot himself.
        The spirit sees himself reflected in the sky (the sky becomes his mirror).
        The house glows with a gentle protective aura instead of scrambled chaos.

     story_beat: That evening, the cousins gather by the tree—the real tree now,
        no strange ornaments. They share tired smiles, each quietly reflecting on
        what they learned about their strengths.
     notes: Quiet interior moment of resolution.

     story_beat: Outside, the house glows gently in the snowy woods, protected by
        a guardian who finally found his sky. Peace settles over Millbrook.
     notes: Closing exterior shot bookending page 1. Guardian spirit implied in
        cloud shapes above.
