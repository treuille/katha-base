# Story Template
# This template defines the shared page-by-page narrative structure for all 6 character books.
# Individual page files are generated in out/story/ using the naming convention:
# p{number}-{characters in alphabetical order}.yaml
# Only the 6 main child characters (arthur, cullan, emer, hansel, henry, james) are included
# in filenames, even if other characters like regan or dorje_legpa appear on the page.

# Default visual style for image generation (can be overridden with --style)
default_style: genealogy_witch

# Haunting Level Visual Framework:
# - none: Warm golden Christmas tones, soft glowing light, cozy atmosphere
# - low: Slight chill creeping in, hints of blue at edges, subtle wrongness
# - medium: Cold blue tones emerging, harsh shadows, geometry slightly off
# - high: Peak wrongness - cold harsh light, pools of darkness, proportions warped, uncanny
# Story setting description (combined with style-specific prompts from story/styles.yaml)
visual:
  - Set in Graminy's large cozy house called Millbrook, deep in the woods of upstate
    New York
  - The house has white aluminum siding and no big external chimney
  - Christmas season atmosphere with festive decorations throughout the house
  - Story takes place during the day with natural daylight filtering through windows
  - Through windows, you can see snowy winter scenes of upstate New York - snow-covered
    trees, woods, and grounds
  - Warm, cozy interior lighting contrasts with the cold, bright winter landscape
    outside
  - Do not add more characters than those listed in the page

    story_beat: A beautiful snowy Christmas Day in Millbrook, with the cozy house
      glowing in the distance. Warm golden light spills from windows.

    location_mode: fixed
    location: living_room
    story_beat: All the kids play happily with their favorite toys around the Christmas
      tree in a warm, bustling living room. Everything is cozy and golden.

    section: Ordinary World
    page_type: individual
    haunting_level: low
    characters: [main_character]
    location_mode: fixed
    location: living_room
    story_beat: The main character plays with their favorite toy, but something about
      the tree catches their attention—an ornament seems to be watching them specifically,
      singling them out. A chill runs through them.
    notes: Build anticipation. The haunting should feel personal and targeted, not
      random. The character should feel singled out from the others. Visual cues -
      slight blue tint at edges, warmth beginning to drain.

   # page 04
  - id: p04
    index: 4
    section: Ordinary World
    page_type: individual
    haunting_level: medium
    characters: [main_character]
    location_mode: fixed
    location: hallway
    story_beat: The main character follows a strange pull toward another part of the
      house. The hallway feels subtly wrong—the warm Christmas colors seem to be draining
      away, replaced by cold blues. Light pools oddly. Angles don't quite match up.
    notes: Build dread through visual wrongness, not scary sounds or whispers. Temperature
      shift visible - breath might frost slightly, warm tones fading. Christmas decorations
      in hallway look slightly tilted, proportions off.

   # page 05
  - id: p05
    index: 5
    section: First Attempt
    page_type: individual
    haunting_level: medium
    characters: [main_character]
    location_mode: by_role
    room_role: first_attempt
    story_beat: The main character steps into the room and sees something dangerous—
      candles have clustered together in one corner, flames burning too high, too
      close to curtains and decorations. A fire hazard that could burn down the whole
      house. The room feels cold despite the flames.
    notes: Location depends on character's first attempt location (attempt_locations[0]).
      Physical danger stakes - fire risk to the house. Cold blue light from windows
      contrasts with warm but threatening candle flames.

   # page 06
  - id: p06
    index: 6
    section: First Attempt
    page_type: individual
    haunting_level: high
    characters: [main_character]
    location_mode: by_role
    room_role: first_attempt
    story_beat: The character uses their speed/strength to blow out candles and move
      them apart, but they keep sliding back together, clustering again. The harder
      they work, the faster the candles return to dangerous positions. Shadows deepen,
      geometry warps further.
    notes: The character's obvious talent works temporarily but misses the point.
      Peak visual haunting - harsh shadows, cold blue dominant, angles wrong.

   # page 07
  - id: p07
    index: 7
    section: First Attempt
    page_type: individual
    haunting_level: high
    characters: [main_character]
    location_mode: by_role
    room_role: first_attempt
    story_beat: The candles keep clustering despite their efforts. The character realizes
      brute force isn't the answer—the candles aren't fighting them, they're being
      unfairly distributed. Something else is needed. They leave the room troubled,
      knowing their obvious skill wasn't the right tool.
    notes: 'First attempt: partial success only. Character realizes the problem is
      about fairness, not speed. Visual haunting remains high as they exit.'

    section: Crossover / Pair
    page_type: pair
    haunting_level: high
    characters: [main_character, pair_partner]
    location_mode: fixed
    location: hallway
    story_beat: The main character bumps into their pair partner in the hall. The
      hallway is at peak wrongness—cold, tilted, shadows pooling strangely. The main
      character describes what they just experienced in their room.
    pair_groups:
      -   - arthur
          - cullan
      -   - james

    location_mode: fixed
    location: hallway
    story_beat: The pair partner describes what happened in their room. Both realize
      they faced similar but different challenges. The hallway around them feels frozen,
      light harsh and wrong.
    pair_groups:
      -   - arthur
          - cullan
      -   - james
          - hansel

    location_mode: fixed
    location: hallway
    story_beat: They compare notes, realizing the connections between their experiences.
      A dawning understanding begins—something is very wrong with this house. The
      visual wrongness is at its peak around them.

      -   - arthur
          - cullan
      -   - james
          - hansel

    section: Crossover / Pair
    page_type: pair
    haunting_level: high
    characters: [main_character, pair_partner]
    location_mode: fixed
    location: hallway
    story_beat: The realization crystallizes—"This house is haunted." They look at
      each other with a mix of fear and determination. The cold blue light and warped
      geometry emphasize the moment's weight.
    pair_groups:
      -   - arthur
          - cullan
      -   - james
          - hansel
      -   - emer
          - henry
    notes: Fourth pair page. Full realization of haunting.

   # page 12
  - id: p12

    section: Crossover / Pair
    page_type: pair
    haunting_level: high
    characters: [main_character, pair_partner]
    location_mode: fixed
    location: hallway
    story_beat: They realize each other's strengths fit the other room better and
      agree to swap which room they will tackle next. A spark of hope despite the
      cold, wrong hallway around them.
    pair_groups:
      -   - arthur
          - cullan
      -   - james
          - hansel
      -   - emer
          - henry
    notes: Fifth pair page. Decision to swap rooms.

    section: Second Attempt
    page_type: individual
    haunting_level: high
    characters: [main_character]
    location_mode: fixed
    location: hallway
    story_beat: The character walks toward their second room with new understanding.
      From ahead, they hear something ominous—a hint of the challenge waiting. But
      this time they know what they're truly capable of.
    notes: Build anticipation again. The character should sense something specific
      from the room ahead. Haunting still high but determination growing.

   # page 14
  - id: p14
    index: 14
    section: Second Attempt
    page_type: individual
    haunting_level: high
    characters: [main_character]
    location_mode: by_role
    room_role: second_attempt
    story_beat: In this room, the haunting attacks them in a new way—not physical
      danger, but making them the villain. Framing them. Accusing them. The room tries
      to twist their identity into something they're not.
    notes: The horror here is about false accusation, being framed, being made into
      the bad guy. Harsh cold light, shadows that seem to point accusingly.

   # page 15
  - id: p15
    index: 15
    section: Second Attempt
    page_type: individual
    haunting_level: medium
    characters: [main_character]
    location_mode: by_role
    room_role: second_attempt
    story_beat: Instead of fighting the rigged game, the character stops and speaks
      their truth with authority. They declare what is right, what is fair, what is
      true about themselves. The room begins to listen. Warmth starts to return at
      the edges.
    notes: The solution is declarative, not physical. As they speak truth, warm golden
      tones begin seeping back in, cold retreating.

   # page 16

    index: 16
    section: Second Attempt
    page_type: individual
    haunting_level: medium
    characters: [main_character]
    location_mode: by_role
    room_role: second_attempt
    story_beat: The room yields completely. The accusations stop. The chaos bows to
      the character's authority. They stand in a space returning to warmth and realize
      they don't just sense what's right—they can command it. Real power.
    notes: 'Second attempt: triumphant payoff. Room SUBMITS. Warm colors returning,
      geometry normalizing, but still some tension in the air.'

    section: Second Attempt
    page_type: individual
    haunting_level: medium
    characters: [main_character]
    location_mode: fixed
    location: hallway
    story_beat: Despite the room's surrender, the character senses the haunting isn't
      fully resolved—something bigger pulses through the house. "This house is completely
      haunted. I need to find my cousins." They start running.
    notes: Transition page. Character realizes individual victory isn't enough. Medium
      haunting - warming but still wrong. Urgency to reunite with others.

    location_mode: fixed
    location: hallway
    story_beat: As each kid finishes their room, they drift into the hallway and sense
      that a larger wrongness is still pulsing through the house. Medium haunting
      - warmer than before, but something still deeply wrong.

    location: living_room
    story_beat: Close-up on Regan's face as she recognizes it—shocked, worried, and
      surprised in a funny way. Behind her, rainbows, deities, lotuses, and other
      Buddhist imagery shimmer in the air as she realizes what the ornament contains.
      She identifies it as Dorje Legpa, a Gyalpo trickster deity whose nature is to
      scramble things.

    location_mode: fixed
    location: living_room
    story_beat: The ornament flares and the spirit erupts, growing huge and blazing
      red. Emer realizes it's furious because it's cramped—too big for a house, it
      needs sky!
    notes: Emer has the insight about the deity being cramped.

    location: living_room
    story_beat: Working together, the children grab the blazing deity and wrestle
      it into a box. The spirit is furious, shining light through every crack, but
      contained. Warmth is returning to the room.
    notes: Simple collective action - they just grab it and box it. No need to recapitulate
      individual superpowers. Funny and chaotic.

    location_mode: fixed
    location: driveway
    story_beat: Outside, Henry jumps into a small WWII-style biplane—open cockpit,
      single wing, propeller in front. He's wearing WWII-style flight goggles pushed
      up on his forehead, but still has his Santa hat on. James acts as air traffic
      controller on the ground—"Spirit Sled Three-Seven-Red, cleared for takeoff!"

    location: driveway
    story_beat: Cullan and Arthur ride in the sled being dragged by the airplane,
      holding the deity in a box. Emer trails behind on a tricycle with Hansel on
      the handlebars, pointing exultantly at the sky with his bottle. The plane lifts
      the sled—not too high, just enough for comedic effect—dragging it across the
      lawn, up over a little bump, maybe through some clouds.

    location_mode: fixed
    location: driveway
    story_beat: The moment the spirit is pulled into open space, it transforms—his
      flames soften into wind, his weapons turn into sparkles, his screaming face
      relaxes. He remembers he's not a monster but a sky guardian who forgot himself.
      The spirit sees himself reflected in the sky (the sky becomes his mirror). The
      house glows with a gentle protective aura instead of scrambled chaos. Full warm
      golden light restored.

    story_beat: That evening, the cousins gather by the tree—the real tree now, no
      strange ornaments. They share tired smiles, each quietly reflecting on what
      they learned about their strengths. Warm golden light, cozy and safe.
    notes: Quiet interior moment of resolution.

    story_beat: Outside, the house glows gently in the snowy woods, protected by a
      guardian who finally found his sky. Peace settles over Millbrook. Full warm
      Christmas colors restored.
    notes: Closing exterior shot bookending page 1. Guardian spirit implied in cloud
      shapes above.
