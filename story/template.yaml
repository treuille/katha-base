# Story Template
# This template defines the shared page-by-page narrative structure for all 6 character books.
# Individual page files are generated in out/story/ using the naming convention:
# p{number}-{characters in alphabetical order}.yaml
# Only the 6 main child characters (arthur, cullan, emer, hansel, henry, james) are included
# in filenames, even if other characters like regan or dorje_legpa appear on the page.

# Default visual style for image generation (can be overridden with --style)
default_style: genealogy_witch

# Haunting Level Visual Framework:
# - none: Warm golden Christmas tones, soft glowing light, cozy atmosphere
# - low: Slight chill creeping in, hints of blue at edges, subtle wrongness
# - medium: Cold blue tones emerging, harsh shadows, geometry slightly off
# - high: Peak wrongness - cold harsh light, pools of darkness, proportions warped, uncanny
# Story setting description (combined with style-specific prompts from story/styles.yaml)
visual:
  - Set in Graminy's large cozy house called Millbrook, deep in the woods of upstate
    New York
  - The house has white aluminum siding and no big external chimney
  - Christmas season atmosphere with festive decorations throughout the house
  - No hanging wreaths or mistletoe anywhere inside the house - only on exterior
  - Story takes place during the day with natural daylight filtering through windows
  - Through windows, you can see snowy winter scenes of upstate New York - snow-covered
    trees, woods, and grounds
  - Warm, cozy interior lighting contrasts with the cold, bright winter landscape
    outside
  - Do not add more characters than those listed in the page

# Dorje Legpa Easter Egg:
# In every interior shot (until the climax where he manifests fully), Dorje Legpa
# should appear as a subtle Easter egg:
# - Living room scenes: He appears as an ornament hanging on the Christmas tree
# - Other interior scenes (hallway, dining room, etc.): He appears as a tiny frozen
#   statuette (no more than 6 inches tall) hiding in a logical place - tucked behind
#   a book, on the corner of a table, behind a chair leg, on a shelf, etc.
# - He should NOT look alive - he looks like a small frozen/inanimate figurine
# - He should be present but subtle, a detail for attentive viewers to spot
# - Add dorje_legpa to the characters list when he appears as Easter egg
# - Exterior scenes do NOT include the Easter egg

    story_beat: The main character notices something watching them from the tree.
    notes: Build anticipation. The haunting should feel personal and targeted, not

    story_beat: The character heads toward their second room with new determination.
    notes: SHORT TRANSITIONAL PAGE - 1 sentence of text only. Focus on movement
      and the character's newfound determination/power. DO NOT reveal or describe
      the challenge ahead - that happens on p13. Atmospheric hints only (shadow,
      light, temperature shift) - NO specific room details, hazards, or descriptions
      of what's wrong. Haunting still high but determination growing.

    notes: THE REVEAL PAGE - This is where the specific challenge is first described.
      Show the character entering and discovering what's wrong. The horror here is
      about false accusation, being framed, being made into the bad guy. Harsh cold
      light, shadows that seem to point accusingly.

      She identifies it as Dorje Legpa, a Gyalpo trickster deity whose nature is to
      scramble things.

      red. James realizes it's furious because it's cramped—too big for a house, it
      needs sky!
    notes: James has the insight about the deity being cramped.
    dorje_legpa_form: FULL MANIFESTATION - erupting huge from ornament, deep crimson
      skin, rainbow light and ice, weapons spinning, too big for the room.

      it into a box. The spirit is furious, shining light through every crack, but
      contained. Warmth is returning to the room.
    notes: Simple collective action - they just grab it and box it. No need to recapitulate
      individual superpowers. Funny and chaotic.
    dorje_legpa_form: BEING CONTAINED - children wrestling furious deity into box,
      rainbow light blazing through cracks, hilariously indignant.

      last summer, but he has something better in mind. He asks where his pilot goggles are.
    dorje_legpa_form: IN SHAKING BOX - glowing box with light blazing through cracks,

      and Arthur holding the box. James underneath traffic controlling. Huge rainbows

      flames soften into wind, his weapons turn into sparkles, his screaming face
      relaxes. He remembers he's not a monster but a sky guardian who forgot himself.
      The spirit sees himself reflected in the sky (the sky becomes his mirror). The
      house glows with a gentle protective aura instead of scrambled chaos. Full warm
      golden light restored.
    dorje_legpa_form: TRANSFORMED/PEACEFUL - fury softened to wind, weapons to sparkles,

      they learned about their own strength. Warm golden light, cozy and safe.
      This is the main character's personal moment of resolution.
    notes: Individual interior moment of resolution for each character. Each character

    story_beat: Book cover showing the main character standing in a hero pose in front
      of the house. Back cover shows a snowy path leading into the distance through
      the woods of upstate New York.
    notes: 'Cover page for each character''s book.
      LAYOUT: Create a flat, full-spread book cover design layout set against a solid
      black background. The composition is divided into three distinct vertical rectangular
      zones separated by thin gaps. The left-hand rectangular panel represents the back
      cover of the book (solid red in reference). The right-hand rectangular panel
      represents the front cover of the book (solid blue in reference). The center panel
      is a narrow vertical strip representing the book spine (solid green in reference).
      The spine section has solid black background with white gothic lettering rotated
      90 degrees.
      FRONT COVER (right panel): Title "[Name] and the Christmas Spirit" prominently
      displayed in top 1/3. Authors "Adrien, Graminy, Henry, and Claude" shown in
      bottom 1/5. Main character in full body hero pose, standing IN FRONT of the house,
      filling the entire cover between title and authors. Character is smiling, confident,
      looking directly out of frame at the reader. The house is behind them as a secondary
      but important element. Setting is snowy upstate New York woods surrounding the house.
      BACK COVER (left panel): A snowy path leading into the distance through the woods.
      Include text "If you liked this book, you will love:" followed by the five other
      book titles (one line per title) - all titles except the current character book.
      EASTER EGGS (subtle, do not change back cover composition): On the back cover,
      the wagon and tricycle should be shown partially buried in the snow near the path.
      In the sky on the left side, a tiny silhouette of the plane flying happily through
      the clouds - no details about the pilot visible, just a small distant shape.'
