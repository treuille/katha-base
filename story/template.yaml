# Only the 6 main child characters (arthur, cullan, emer, hansel, henry, james) are included
# in filenames, even if other characters like regan or dorje_legpa appear on the page.

     story_beat: Cullan and Arthur ride in the sled being dragged by the airplane,
        holding the deity in a box. Emer trails behind on a tricycle with Hansel on
        the handlebars, pointing exultantly at the sky with his bottle. The plane
        lifts the sled—not too high, just enough for comedic effect—dragging it across

     location: driveway
     story_beat: The moment the spirit is pulled into open space, it transforms—his
        flames soften into wind, his weapons turn into sparkles, his screaming face
        relaxes. He remembers he's not a monster but a sky guardian who forgot himself.
        The spirit sees himself reflected in the sky (the sky becomes his mirror).
        The house glows with a gentle protective aura instead of scrambled chaos.
