# Story Template
# This template defines the shared page-by-page narrative structure for all 6 character books.
# Individual page files are generated in out/story/ using the naming convention:
# p{number}-{characters in alphabetical order}.yaml
# Only the 6 main child characters (arthur, cullan, emer, hansel, henry, james) are included
# in filenames, even if other characters like regan or dorje_legpa appear on the page.

# Default visual style for image generation (can be overridden with --style)
default_style: genealogy_witch

# Haunting Level Visual Framework:
# - none: Warm golden Christmas tones, soft glowing light, cozy atmosphere
# - low: Slight chill creeping in, hints of blue at edges, subtle wrongness
# - medium: Cold blue tones emerging, harsh shadows, geometry slightly off
# - high: Peak wrongness - cold harsh light, pools of darkness, proportions warped, uncanny
# Story setting description (combined with style-specific prompts from story/styles.yaml)
visual:
  - Set in Graminy's large cozy house called Millbrook, deep in the woods of upstate
    New York
  - The house has white aluminum siding and no big external chimney
  - Christmas season atmosphere with festive decorations throughout the house
  - No hanging wreaths or mistletoe anywhere inside the house - only on exterior
  - Story takes place during the day with natural daylight filtering through windows
  - Through windows, you can see snowy winter scenes of upstate New York - snow-covered
    trees, woods, and grounds
  - Warm, cozy interior lighting contrasts with the cold, bright winter landscape
    outside
  - Do not add more characters than those listed in the page

# Dorje Legpa Easter Egg:
# In every interior shot (until the climax where he manifests fully), Dorje Legpa
# should appear as a subtle Easter egg:
# - Living room scenes: He appears as an ornament hanging on the Christmas tree
# - Other interior scenes (hallway, dining room, etc.): He appears as a tiny frozen
#   statuette (no more than 6 inches tall) hiding in a logical place - tucked behind
#   a book, on the corner of a table, behind a chair leg, on a shelf, etc.
# - He should NOT look alive - he looks like a small frozen/inanimate figurine
# - He should be present but subtle, a detail for attentive viewers to spot
# - Add dorje_legpa to the characters list when he appears as Easter egg
# - Exterior scenes do NOT include the Easter egg

    story_beat: The moment the spirit is pulled into open space, it transforms—his
      flames soften into wind, his weapons turn into sparkles, his screaming face
      relaxes. He remembers he's not a monster but a sky guardian who forgot himself.
      The spirit sees himself reflected in the sky (the sky becomes his mirror). The
      house glows with a gentle protective aura instead of scrambled chaos. Full warm
      golden light restored.
