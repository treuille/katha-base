description: Elise tries to restore color by painting over the faded parts, but her ordinary paints can't reach what's truly wrong.

  Elise kneels in a meadow in Kathaél, surrounded by flowers that have lost their
  vibrancy—pale pink instead of rose, dull blue instead of sapphire. She holds a
  small watercolor set in her left hand (which somehow came with her from her world)
  and a paintbrush in her right. She's leaning forward, carefully trying to paint
  color back onto a faded flower, her tongue poking out slightly in concentration.
  But the paint she applies—though it's her best work, carefully done—sits on the
  surface of the flower without sinking in, forming small beads like water on a leaf.
  The flower remains pale beneath her efforts. Around her are several other flowers
  she's already tried to paint, showing the same problem: ordinary paint can't
  restore what's been lost. Her expression shows growing frustration and confusion—
  brow furrowed, a slight frown. This isn't how things usually work when she draws.
  The meadow extends around her with dozens more faded flowers and plants stretching
  into the distance, an overwhelming task. The sky above is soft grey instead of the
  vibrant colors it should be. A few golden threads from the Heart-Loom are visible
  overhead, but they're thin and weak. Small forest creatures—rabbits, birds—watch
  from the edges of the meadow with sympathetic but knowing eyes, as if they
  understand that she needs to discover something deeper.

  Elise painted as carefully as she could, but her colors wouldn't stick. She felt her stomach tighten with worry—what if she wasn't enough?
