  Elise stands in the same central nexus, but everything has transformed with gentle
  beauty. The hundreds of golden threads of the Heart-Loom now glow warmly,
  interwoven with soft colors that pulse and flow—watercolor washes of lavender,
  rose, sage, amber, sky blue—all moving through the tapestry like slow breathing.
  Elise's own light has extended from her heart into the web, not as a single bright
  thread but as a soft suffusion of color that touches everything. She stands with
  both hands raised to chest height, and resting across her palms is a gift from the
  Heart-Loom: a small, perfect paintbrush made of light and golden thread, its
  bristles shimmering with all the colors of Kathaél. Her expression is one of quiet
  wonder and shy joy—eyes wide and bright, a soft smile, a slight flush in her
  cheeks. She looks both surprised and deeply validated. Around her, the clearing
  and forest beyond have fully regained their colors—not loud or harsh, but gentle
  and alive, the watercolor etherealism that defines Kathaél. Flowers bloom in soft
  hues, trees shimmer with subtle light, and the ground glows faintly. The creatures
  who witnessed her choice are now celebrating gently: the rabbit hops in a small
  circle, birds sing softly, the deer bows its head in acknowledgment. Particles of
  colored light drift through the air like blessings. In the distance, the path
  leading back toward her world is visible, lined with flowers in full color.

  Her small light spread through the Heart-Loom like watercolor on wet paper, and Kathaél remembered all its gentle colors. Elise received a brush of starlight—proof that noticing matters.
