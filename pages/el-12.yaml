visual: |
  Elise sits at her small desk in the exact same position as the opening, creating
  a drawing, but everything is subtly transformed. She's drawing with focused joy,
  and the colored pencil in her hand—an ordinary colored pencil—now carries a faint
  shimmer as if remembering the magical paintbrush from Kathaél. The drawing she's
  working on shows a meadow full of flowers in gentle, beautiful colors, and every
  flower on the page glows very softly with its own light—not because the paper is
  magical, but because she now draws with the same patient attention she learned in
  Kathaél. Her expression is peaceful and content, a small smile on her face, her
  posture relaxed and confident in a way it wasn't before. The afternoon light
  through the window is the same, but now there are barely visible golden threads
  woven into the light itself, a permanent connection to the Heart-Loom. On the wall
  behind her, her other drawings have all begun to show this same subtle glow—as if
  they've always been connected to something real, and she's only now able to see it.
  Her watercolor set sits open on the desk, and one paintbrush—the one that
  corresponds to the gift from Kathaél—shimmers with golden light so subtle that
  anyone else would think it was just catching the sun. Her room is the same cozy
  space with the same creative mess, but everything feels more alive, more connected.
  Outside the window, an ordinary garden shows ordinary flowers, but one butterfly
  with faintly luminescent wings rests on the windowsill, watching her draw.

  Elise picked up her colored pencils and began to draw—noticing every color, every shadow, every small thing that mattered. She knew now that her gentle way of seeing was exactly enough.
