  Elise is suspended in a moment between worlds—her bedroom and Kathaél existing
  simultaneously in the same space. She's standing now, having risen from her desk,
  with her right hand extended forward, fingertips touching a shimmering portal where
  her drawing used to be. The paper has transformed into a doorway of light and
  color. Her body is angled forward, one foot lifted as if she's being gently pulled
  through, but her face shows wonder rather than fear—mouth softly open, eyes wide
  and bright. Through the portal, Kathaél is visible: a meadow where the colors are
  beautiful but noticeably faded, as if a watercolor painting has been left too long
  in the sun. Flowers that should be vibrant appear washed out. Trees that should
  glow with the Heart-Loom's light are dim. Behind her, her ordinary room is becoming
  translucent, fading like a memory. Her desk, her drawings, her lamp—all becoming
  ghostly and see-through. Golden threads from the Heart-Loom reach toward her from
  the Kathaél side, recognizing something in her. A small, luminescent butterfly—one
  of Kathaél's creatures—has already crossed over and rests on her shoulder, as if
  guiding her forward. The light has a dreamlike quality, soft and inviting.

  When Elise touched the drawing, she felt herself being pulled in—not roughly, but like a gentle invitation. A world waited that needed someone who noticed when colors dimmed.
