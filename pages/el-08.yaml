  Elise stands at the edge of an enormous garden that stretches to the horizon—
  thousands of flowers, bushes, and trees all drained of color, everything rendered
  in shades of grey and pale ash. She's stopped walking, standing very still, her
  arms wrapped around herself in a self-protective hug. Her head is bowed, chin
  tucked down, and her whole posture shows overwhelming discouragement. Her small
  watercolor set has fallen from her hands and lies on the ground beside her feet,
  its colors seeming pointless against this vast sea of grey. Her expression, visible
  in profile, shows tears on her cheeks—quiet crying, not dramatic, but the deep
  sadness of feeling too small for the task. The garden before her is beautiful in
  structure but heartbreaking in its colorlessness: elegant paths that wind through
  flowerbeds, graceful trees with perfect forms but no vibrancy, a fountain in the
  distance that flows with grey water. The sky above is overcast and heavy. Golden
  threads from the Heart-Loom cross above the garden, but they're so faint they're
  almost invisible, like spider webs barely catching the light. The scale of the
  fading is overwhelming—how could one gentle nine-year-old possibly restore all of
  this? In the near foreground, one small flower has retained a hint of color—perhaps
  from her earlier work—but she hasn't noticed it, focused as she is on the
  impossible vastness.

  Elise looked at all the grey and felt impossibly small. Her gentle way had helped a few flowers, but how could that ever be enough?
