  Elise sits cross-legged on soft moss in a small clearing, having left behind the
  loud artist-spirit. Her watercolor set rests open beside her, but she's not using
  it. Instead, both her hands are cupped gently around a single faded flower—a small
  bloom that's barely more than grey. She's not painting it or doing anything to it,
  just holding space around it with tender attention, the way she might hold a small
  injured bird. Her head is bowed slightly, looking down at the flower with soft
  focus, and her expression is peaceful and nurturing—the gentle, empathetic part of
  her nature fully present. As she holds this space, something remarkable is
  happening: the flower is very slowly regaining color, starting from its center and
  bleeding outward in subtle gradations—from grey to pale lavender to soft purple.
  It's responding not to paint or force, but to her caring attention. Around the
  clearing, a few golden threads from the Heart-Loom drift closer, drawn to this
  gentle approach, beginning to glow more brightly. Small particles of light—like
  luminescent pollen—drift in the air around her. A rabbit sits nearby, watching
  with approval. The light in the clearing is soft dawn light, and the atmosphere is
  hushed and reverent. This is a moment of genuine understanding: she's discovered
  that Kathaél responds to compassion and presence, not assertion.

  When Elise stopped trying to fix and just paid attention, something shifted. The flower remembered its color, petal by petal, as if it just needed someone to witness it.
