  Elise stands at the center of the Heart-Loom's nexus, in a vast space where
  hundreds of faded golden threads converge. Unlike Noah's dramatic stance, Elise
  stands quietly, her hands held at her sides but with palms facing outward, fingers
  slightly spread—an open, offering gesture. Her body is very still, but there's a
  tension in her shoulders and neck showing how much courage this is taking for her.
  Inside her chest, visible through a soft transparency, a light glows—her own inner
  light, gentle and warm like candlelight rather than a blazing sun. This light wants
  to extend outward into the Heart-Loom, but she's hesitating, afraid it's too small,
  too quiet to matter. Her expression shows fear and determination mingled together:
  eyes closed as if gathering courage, a slight trembling in her jaw, but her stance
  holding steady. Around her, the faded threads seem to lean toward her hopefully,
  as if they recognize what she carries. The space is vast and quiet, waiting without
  pressure. At her feet, her watercolor set lies open, its colors beginning to glow
  more brightly, responding to her inner light. Small creatures of Kathaél have
  gathered in a circle around her at a respectful distance—rabbits, foxes, birds,
  a deer—all bearing witness to this moment. The light in the nexus is dim, waiting
  for her choice. It's a threshold moment: she must believe her gentle light is
  enough, or turn away.

  Elise felt her light—small and gentle, like a candle, not a bonfire. She worried it wasn't enough, but the Heart-Loom waited as if it knew something she didn't.
