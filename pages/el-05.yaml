# Elise - Spread 5: Bigger World

id: el-05
spread: 5
beat: "Attempt #3 (bigger world / stakes up)"

hook: Questionable character offers confident solution, creating doubt about whether to trust them.
payoff: The suggested solution fails spectacularly and obviously wrong.

description: Elise meets a dazzling artist-spirit who insists that bold, loud colors are the answer, but the approach feels wrong to her gentle nature.

  Elise stands in a circular plaza in Kathaél where the fading is more severe—trees
  that should shimmer with life are nearly grey, the ground that should glow softly
  is dull. Facing her is a striking, dramatic figure: an artist-spirit draped in
  swirling scarves of clashing, oversaturated colors—electric purple, harsh orange,
  screaming pink. This spirit gestures wildly with both arms, holding giant brushes
  that drip with garish paint. Behind the spirit, several trees and plants have been
  "restored" with these loud colors, but they look wrong—forced and artificial rather
  than natural and alive. The colors clash with Kathaél's gentle aesthetic. Elise
  stands with her watercolor set clutched to her chest, her posture showing
  hesitation and discomfort. She's taking a small step backward, one hand raised
  slightly as if to say "wait." Her expression shows polite uncertainty—she doesn't
  want to be rude, but something about this feels very wrong. Around them, various
  creatures of Kathaél have fled or are hiding, clearly disturbed by the loud colors.
  The plaza should be a place of beauty and harmony, but the artist-spirit's work
  has made it jarring and uncomfortable. Golden threads of the Heart-Loom that pass
  near the garish colors actually dim further, as if recoiling. Elise's gentle,
  observant nature is picking up on all these details, creating internal conflict
  between wanting help and trusting her own instincts.

  The spirit painted everything in bright, shouty colors that made Elise's eyes hurt. It looked impressive, but it didn't feel like the Kathaél she'd glimpsed—gentle and glowing.
