# Visual description - a single instant in time
visual: |
  The edge of a misty ravine where a broken bridge of starlight stretches partway
  across before fading into nothing. Noah (12, sandy blond hair) kneels on the left
  side of the glowing bridge, both hands pressed against the translucent surface,
  looking down at where it ends abruptly in midair. His brow is furrowed with
  frustration and exhaustion. On the right side of the same bridge segment, Elise
  (9, slim, graceful) sits with her legs dangling over the edge, head bowed, arms
  wrapped around herself. Between them on the bridge surface, faint golden threads
  from the Heart-Loom pulse weakly, as if struggling to maintain form. The ravine
  below them is deep and filled with swirling blue-grey mist. On the far side—
  distant and hazy—the continuation of their respective paths glows faintly,
  tantalizingly out of reach. The sky above is twilight, caught between day and
  night. Small moths with luminescent wings circle around them. The overall mood
  is weary but not hopeless—both children are tired, but still present, still
  trying. They are positioned so each can see the other's determination in
  peripheral vision.

  Noah looked up and saw Elise still there, still trying. In that moment, neither felt quite so alone.
