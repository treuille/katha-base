# Visual description - a single instant in time
visual: |
  A crossroads in Kathaél where multiple forest paths meet beneath an ancient willow
  tree whose branches glow softly with golden threads from the Heart-Loom. Noah (12
  years old, sandy blond hair, medium build) stands on the left path, one hand extended
  toward a shimmering thread that hovers in the air at eye level, his expression
  focused and curious. Elise (9 years old, slim, graceful) stands on the right path,
  her head tilted as she observes a different glowing thread, her hand raised gently
  as if about to touch it. Between them, the threads weave and intersect in midair,
  creating a soft lattice of golden light. Both children are shown in profile, not
  quite looking at each other but aware of each other's presence. The ground is soft
  moss with small luminescent mushrooms dotting the edges of each path. Morning mist
  rolls through the background forest. The willow's drooping branches frame the scene
  like a natural archway, their leaves catching the golden glow. Small particles of
  light drift through the air like fireflies. The atmosphere is hushed, reverent,
  and filled with gentle magic.

  At the crossroads, Noah and Elise each reached for a glowing thread. Without speaking, they felt the same pull forward—toward something just beyond what they could see.
