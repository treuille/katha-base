visual: |
  A circular clearing in Kathaél where the Heart-Loom manifests most strongly—a
  space where dozens of golden threads spiral upward from the ground like a gentle
  tornado of light, weaving together above to form a radiant canopy. Noah (12,
  sandy blond hair, medium build) stands on the left side of the clearing, his
  right foot lifted mid-step toward the threads, his arms slightly extended forward,
  his face showing a mixture of determination and wonder. His eyes are open wide,
  catching the golden glow. Elise (9, slim, graceful, gentle presence) mirrors him
  on the right side, also stepping forward, her hands reaching out palms-up as if
  to receive something precious, her expression soft but resolute. They are moving
  toward the center simultaneously but from different angles—each on their own path,
  but their movements are synchronized. The golden threads respond to their movement,
  brightening and swirling more vibrantly. Around the clearing's perimeter, small
  forest creatures have gathered to watch: rabbits, foxes with luminous eyes, birds
  perched in low branches. The ground beneath the threads is covered in soft grass
  that glows faintly. The lighting is warm and hopeful, like dawn breaking. Between
  Noah and Elise, though they are focused on their own paths, there is a sense of
  shared presence—an invisible thread connecting their courage.

  As Noah stepped forward, he glimpsed Elise doing the same. Each drew strength from knowing another heart had chosen bravely.
