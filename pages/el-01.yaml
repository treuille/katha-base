  Elise (9 years old, slim build, medium height, graceful, gentle presence) sits at
  a small desk by her window, hunched slightly forward over a drawing she's creating.
  Her right hand holds a colored pencil—a golden yellow—hovering just above the
  paper as she concentrates. Her left hand rests gently on the edge of the paper to
  steady it. Several other colored pencils are scattered on the desk, along with an
  open box of art supplies. Her expression is peaceful and absorbed, showing the
  quiet focus of someone lost in creative flow. The drawing visible on her paper
  shows a forest scene with trees, flowers, and what appears to be a path leading
  somewhere mysterious. Afternoon light comes through the window, but there's
  something unusual: one small section of her drawing—a flower she just finished—
  actually glows with a soft golden light that doesn't match the ordinary lamp light.
  She's just beginning to notice this, her head tilting slightly, eyes widening with
  curiosity but not fear. Her room is cozy and slightly messy in a creative way:
  more drawings pinned to the wall, a dance outfit draped over a chair, stuffed
  animals on the bed. The glowing flower on her paper seems to pulse very gently, as
  if breathing.

  Elise loved drawing quiet places where magic might hide. Today, one of her drawings started to glow, as if it wanted to become real.
