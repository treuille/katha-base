# Storybook Pages (ordered list)
# NEW STRUCTURE (Post-Refactor):
# - Each spread has 2 pages (24 pages total for 12 spreads)
# - File naming: {char}-{spread}-{page}.yaml (e.g., cu-01-1.yaml, cu-01-2.yaml)
# - For shared pages: {char1}-{char2}-{spread}-{page}.yaml (alphabetical order)
# - Each page contains 2 images
#
# Initially this list is empty when we create the character
# But more will get added as we follow the story creation steps
# (see Readme.md).
# NOTE: Pages should be shown without path `cu-01-1.yaml` rather than `pages/cu-01-1.yaml`
story:
  # Spread 1 (must be character-specific)
  - cu-01-1.yaml  # Spread 1, page 1 (left page)
  - cu-01-2.yaml  # Spread 1, page 2 (right page)

  # Spread 2 (can be solo or resonant)
  - cu-02-1.yaml
  - cu-02-2.yaml

  # Spread 3 (example of shared pages with another character, e.g., Maya)
  # Character codes are in alphabetical order
  # These pages would be mirrored or meeting nodes
  - cu-ma-03-1.yaml  # Both characters in parallel or together, page 1
  - cu-ma-03-2.yaml  # Both characters in parallel or together, page 2

  # Continue pattern for all 12 spreads...
