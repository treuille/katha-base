what_makes_it_interesting: |
  Fantasia is a realm where imagination becomes reality, and every thought
  can reshape the landscape around you. The world responds to creativity and
  emotion, making it a place of endless wonder and possibility. Ancient magic
  flows through everything, from the smallest pebble to the grandest mountain,
  creating a living, breathing tapestry of wonder.

# What's the visual style?
# How does this world look? What's the aesthetic, color palette, atmosphere?
visual_style: |
  The world has a dreamlike, watercolor quality where colors bleed and blend
  into each other. Soft pastels dominate during peaceful moments, while vibrant
  jewel tones emerge during times of excitement or danger. Architecture features
  impossible geometries and gravity-defying structures that seem to defy logic
  yet feel perfectly natural. Everything has a gentle glow, as if lit by an
  unseen magical source.

# What makes it mysterious?
# What secrets does this world hold? What questions remain unanswered?
what_makes_it_mysterious: |
  Deep within Fantasia lie the Forgotten Gardens, places where old dreams go
  when they're no longer remembered. Strange whispers echo from ancient trees,
  speaking in languages no one understands anymore. Some areas of the world
  shift and change when no one's looking, and there are doors that appear only
  to certain people at certain times, leading to places that shouldn't exist.

# What might the reader not already know about the world when they first encounter it?
# What surprising truths or hidden aspects will be revealed over time?
hidden_aspects: |
  While the world seems whimsical and safe on the surface, it has a deeper
  purpose: it's actually a sanctuary for endangered imaginations from countless
  other worlds. The inhabitants don't realize they're guardians of something
  precious and fragile. Every story told in Fantasia strengthens the fabric
  between worlds, and every act of kindness plants seeds that will grow into
  new possibilities.

# How is it similar to the world that we live in?
# What familiar elements help readers connect with this world?
similarities_to_our_world: |
  Families still gather for meals and share stories. Children still play and
  explore. People still feel joy, sadness, fear, and hope. The bonds of
  friendship and love are just as powerful and important. Day turns to night,
  seasons change, and life follows rhythms that feel comforting and familiar.
  The fundamental experiences of growing, learning, and connecting remain
  universal.

# How is it different from the world that we live in?
# What sets this world apart? What rules or properties make it unique?
differences_from_our_world: |
  In Fantasia, emotions have physical manifestations - happiness might create
  floating lights, while sadness could summon gentle rain. The laws of physics
  are more like suggestions, bending to accommodate wonder and impossibility.
  Time doesn't flow in quite the same way; a moment can stretch into an
  adventure, or hours can pass in what feels like seconds. Animals can speak
  if they choose to, and objects might have personalities and preferences of
  their own.
