# Page Template
#
# NEW LAYOUT STRUCTURE (Post-Refactor):
# - Each spread contains 2 pages (left and right)
# - Each page contains 2 images
# - Each image contains 2-3 sentences of text
# - File naming: {char-code}-{spread}-{page}.yaml (e.g., cu-03-1.yaml for page 1, cu-03-2.yaml for page 2)
#
# Eventually, we will create a custom /command that can create
# a bunch of pages all at once.

# Should be equal to the name of the file
# This means "Cullan spread 3, page 1"
id: cu-03-1 # The name of the file

# See `templates/story-template.yaml` for documentation
# Should match the ID and the filename
spread: 3

# Page number within the spread (1 or 2)
# Page 1 = left page, Page 2 = right page when spread is open
page: 1

# Node type for this page (solo, meeting, mirrored, resonant)
# See templates/story-template.yaml for allowed node types per spread
node_type: solo

# This is an ultra-short description of where we are in the story.
# Initially, copy this from `templates/story-template.yaml` for this spread
beat: "Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)"

# This is what "hooks them" into the next pages
# Initially, copy this from `templates/story-template.yaml` for this spread
hook: Simple solutions fail, prompting the question of who might have better answers.

# This is the payoff from the previous spread's hook
# Initially, copy this from `templates/story-template.yaml` for this spread
payoff: A wise helper appears who offers new perspective or guidance.

# This is a short (1-2 sentences) which describes what you see on the page.
description: Cullan tries to climb up the ladder but finds it too slippery.

# Images on this page
# Each page contains 2 images, arranged top-to-bottom or left-to-right
# Each image has its own visual description and text (2-3 sentences)
images:
  # Image 1 (top or left)
  - image_number: 1
    # The visual description can be very long and detailed to convey the scene
    # IMPORTANT: Describe a SINGLE INSTANT IN TIME - not a sequence of actions
    # - Describe WHAT is happening at this exact moment (the action, poses, expressions)
    # - Describe WHERE things are (positions, spatial relationships, background details)
    # - Include specific visual details about the world, objects, and environment
    # - Do NOT include stylistic suggestions (those come from world.yaml)
    # - Do NOT describe multiple moments or a sequence of events

      Cullan stands at the base of a massive oak tree, looking up at a wooden ladder
      propped against its trunk. His hands rest on the ladder's sides, testing its
      stability. The ladder's rungs glisten with moisture from morning dew. Around
      him on the mossy ground lie scattered tools: a coil of rope, a small hammer,
      and a leather pouch. The forest surrounds them - tall trees with thick trunks,
      dense undergrowth of ferns. Morning light filters through the canopy creating
      dappled shadows on the forest floor. Mushrooms grow at the base of nearby trees.

    # Text for this image
    # IMPORTANT: Keep text to 2-3 sentences. Be concise but complete.
    text: |
      Cullan had a plan: climb the old oak tree and reach the bird's nest at the top.
      He gripped the ladder with both hands, ready to start his ascent.

  # Image 2 (bottom or right)
  - image_number: 2
    visual: |
      Cullan is mid-slip, falling backwards off the wooden ladder. His body is angled
      diagonally, arms spread wide, eyes wide with surprise, mouth open in shock. The
      ladder tilts dangerously against the oak tree, its rungs clearly too slick to
      grip. His feet have lost contact with the rungs completely. The tools on the
      ground below are visible in the background. The forest setting remains the same,
      but the perspective captures the moment of failure - the instant when his confident
      plan goes wrong.

      The first rung was slippery with dew, and Cullan's foot slid off.
      Before he could catch himself, he was falling backwards toward the ground.
