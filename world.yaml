  The Enchanted Forest is a watery forest world brimming with waterfalls and
  streams that flow through every corner. Frogs are everywhere, hopping between
  lily pads and mossy stones, while fish swim mysteriously inside the forest
  itself, as if the air and water have become one. Living within the trees are
  strange and unusual characters with long limbs, long noses, and strange eyes
  that peer out from the shadows and hollows of ancient trunks.

# What's the visual style?
# How does this world look? What's the aesthetic, color palette, atmosphere?
visual_style: |
  The world is rendered in highly detailed pattern ink work, with intricate
  textures and linework forming the foundation of every surface. Soft
  watercolors wash over the top, creating depth and atmosphere. The watery
  nature of the forest is emphasized through flowing, organic patterns, with
  delicate ripples and currents visible throughout. The combination of precise
  ink details and gentle watercolor washes gives the forest a dreamlike yet
  tangible quality.

# What makes it mysterious?
# What secrets does this world hold? What questions remain unanswered?
what_makes_it_mysterious: |
  The Enchanted Forest feels like an endless maze where you can never quite
  find your bearings. Paths twist and turn, streams flow in impossible
  directions, and you never know which way you're going. The deeper you venture,
  the more lost you become, yet there's always a sense that something wonderful
  - or strange - awaits around the next bend. The forest keeps its secrets well,
  revealing them only to those who truly listen.

# What might the reader not already know about the world when they first encounter it?
# What surprising truths or hidden aspects will be revealed over time?
hidden_aspects: |
  Beneath the surface of the Enchanted Forest lies a secret underground world
  within the world. This hidden realm exists in the spaces between tree roots,
  beneath flowing streams, and in caverns carved by ancient waterways. What
  appears to be the entire forest is only the beginning - there's an entire
  world below, waiting to be discovered by those brave or curious enough to
  seek it out.

# How is it similar to the world that we live in?
# What familiar elements help readers connect with this world?
similarities_to_our_world: |
  In the Enchanted Forest, everyone knows each other and are friends. There's
  a little house where the family lives, providing a warm and familiar center
  to the strange world around them. People still gather, share meals, and care
  for one another. The bonds of friendship and family remain just as important
  and comforting as in our own world.

# How is it different from the world that we live in?
# What sets this world apart? What rules or properties make it unique?
differences_from_our_world: |
  The Enchanted Forest is much more magical and mysterious than our world.
  Water flows through the air as easily as through streams, fish swim between
  trees, and creatures with impossible proportions - long limbs, long noses,
  strange eyes - make their homes in the forest. The laws of nature bend and
  shift, creating a place where wonder and impossibility are woven into the
  very fabric of existence.
