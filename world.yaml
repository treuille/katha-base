name: Kathaél

# Core concept
description: |
  Kathaél is a luminous, enchanted realm shaped by the **inner courage** of its inhabitants.
  Every honest or heartfelt choice becomes a glowing thread in the **Heart-Loom**, a living
  tapestry that binds the world together. Landscapes subtly shift in response to sincerity:
  paths open, soft lights appear, and magical creatures stir awake. Each child's story unfolds
  in a different region, but key decisions send ripples across the realm, creating moments where
  their journeys **intersect**. These interlocking points are called **Synchrony Nodes**, where
  two characters' choices align and reveal new possibilities. Kathaél exists outside ordinary
  time — a story-realm built around wonder, connection, and the quiet bravery of choosing what
  matters.

# What's the visual style?
# How does this world look? What's the aesthetic, color palette, atmosphere?
# This is used for prompting the visual system.
visual_style:
  - Watercolor Etherealism with Fine Ink Linework - soft watercolor washes paired with delicate ink lines, dreamlike yet grounded
  - Colors blend gently with mist blues, warm creams, honey golds, with brighter jewel tones appearing when magic stirs
  - The atmosphere feels warm, intimate, and slightly glowing, as if courage adds its own light to the scene
  - Magical elements are subtle - a shimmer around leaves, gold flecks in waterfalls, or luminous threads drifting through the air
  - Settings include responsive forests, glowing meadows, cozy lantern-lit villages, and ancient bridges of starlight
  - Everything looks hand-painted, organic, and quietly enchanted
  - A world where emotion shapes the landscape and children's choices guide the way
  - When the Heart-Loom is active, glowing golden threads appear in the air, weaving through scenes
  - Synchrony Nodes manifest as points of radiant light where paths or landscapes align
