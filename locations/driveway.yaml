haunting_theme: The outside world waits as the true home for the spirit once it is safely contained.
description_short: Snowy yard and driveway where the kids carry the trapped spirit away and the house becomes peacefully protected.

release_lead_character: henry
group_role: All kids participate in the sky procession where the spirit transforms and the house becomes peaceful.

notes: Henry flies the toy airplane. James acts as air traffic controller. Cullan and Arthur ride in the wagon holding the deity box. Emer trails on a tricycle with Hansel on the handlebars pointing exultantly at the sky with his bottle. The spirit transforms in open space and the house glows with a protective aura.
