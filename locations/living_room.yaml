kind: hub

haunting_theme: The Christmas tree hosts a mismatched ornament holding Dorje Legpa, a Gyalpo trickster deity that scrambles the whole house.
description_short: Central family room with the Christmas tree, where the spirit is discovered, named, and contained before being taken outside.

climax_focus_character: henry
group_role: All kids gather here for the climax and use their room-discovered superpowers together to contain the spirit.

notes: Wrongly tagged presents, flickering lights, and uneasy tree energy all originate here. The spirit erupts blazing red and furious—too big for a bedroom, it needs sky. Kids contain it on the red wagon (hilarious, complaining and wiggling).
