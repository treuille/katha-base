description_short: Busy kitchen where jars are mislabeled, recipes rewrite themselves, and food is almost—but not quite—edible.

first_whack_summary: Emer organizes some of the obvious mess and gets a dish to work a bit better, but the underlying recipe logic is still wrong.
second_whack_summary: Henry invents a new baked treat meant for friends and follows a clear 'pilot-like' checklist, teaching the kitchen what a true recipe should be.
