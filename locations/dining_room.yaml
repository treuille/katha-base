haunting_theme: The candles rebel against fair distribution. They cluster dangerously
  in one corner, flames burning too high, too close to curtains—a fire hazard that
  threatens the whole house. No matter how you spread them apart, they slide back
  together, refusing to be distributed fairly.
description_short: Formal dining room where Christmas candles have mysteriously
  clustered into one dangerous corner, flames threatening the curtains. The room
  resists any attempt to distribute them fairly.

attempts:
  - character: cullan
    summary: Cullan sees the fire danger and uses his speed to blow out candles and
      spread them around the room—but they keep sliding back together. Speed can't
      solve unfair distribution.
  - character: arthur
    summary: Arthur sees the pattern in how the candles cluster and rearranges them
      into a balanced configuration that finally holds—restoring spatial harmony.
