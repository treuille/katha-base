haunting_theme: The games frame and accuse. Rules twist to make whoever plays look
  like a cheater—dice roll double sixes at the wrong moment, cards change suits in
  your hand, and a voice keeps announcing "CHEATER." The room makes you the villain.
description_short: Chaotic playroom where every game is rigged to frame the player
  as a cheater. No matter how carefully you play, hidden rules twist to make you guilty.

attempts:
  - character: arthur
    summary: Arthur matches pieces to the right boxes and restores basic logic, but
      the deeper accusation system remains—the games still frame anyone who plays.
  - character: cullan
    summary: Cullan realizes the games aren't just unfair—they're designed to frame
      him as a cheater. Instead of playing along, he stops and declares what fair
      means with authority. The games have to listen. They bow to his commands,
      the accusations fall silent, and he discovers he can command fairness—real power.
