first_whack_summary: Hänsel, using his intense pointing, helps restore the stockings to the right spots, but the staircase still feels directionally off.
second_whack_summary: James creates a clear, creative 'stairs ritual' that turns the staircase into a guided path toward where people truly want to go.
