visual: |
  - Cullan standing in the hallway, laptop abandoned behind him
  - Looking toward the dining room with growing dread
  - Shadows that seem to LEAN AWAY from him, as if rejecting his presence
  - Faint candlelight flickering erratically through the doorway ahead
  - His expression shifting from curiosity to fear
  - The hallway feeling hostile, unwelcoming, wrong

  Cullan stepped into the hallway and froze. He heard his name whispered from somewhere ahead—but wrong. "Cull-AN. Cull-AN." Then silence where his name should have been, like someone had erased it mid-word. The shadows seemed to lean away from him. Even the hallway didn't want him here.
