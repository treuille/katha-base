visual: |
  - Ultra-flat illustration style with bold flat colors and no 3D shading
  - Cullan stands in the hallway, head tilted, listening intently
  - Distant flickering light spills from a doorway ahead (the dining room)
  - His posture is athletic and alert—ready to move like a sprinter
  - Shadows on the walls seem slightly wrong, as if light sources keep shifting
  - His black Apple Watch visible on his wrist as he raises one hand to steady himself

  Cullan followed a flickering glow down the hallway. Candles? The light kept stuttering, on and off, like something was blowing them out. His feet moved quietly on the wooden floor as he approached the dining room door.
