story_beat: Cullan follows a strange pull toward the dining room. The hallway feels
  subtly wrong—warm Christmas colors draining away, replaced by cold blues. Light
  pools oddly. Angles don't quite match up.

visual: |
  - Cullan standing in the hallway, black gaming laptop abandoned behind him
  - Looking toward the dining room with growing unease
  - The hallway's warm Christmas colors visibly DRAINING, being replaced by cold blue tones
  - Light pooling in wrong places, creating harsh shadows
  - Christmas decorations on the wall looking slightly tilted, proportions off
  - His breath might frost slightly—temperature dropping
  - The angles of doorframes and walls not quite matching up, subtly uncanny
  - His ice-blue eyes alert, sensing something deeply wrong

  Something pulled Cullan toward the dining room—a strange tug he couldn't explain. The hallway felt wrong. The warm Christmas colors seemed to be draining away, replaced by cold blues. Lights pooled in odd places. The doorframe ahead looked... tilted? His breath came out in a little cloud of frost. The house itself felt like it was holding its breath.
