visual: |
  - Cullan standing in the hallway, laptop closed under his arm
  - Looking toward the dining room with furrowed brow
  - A faint flicker of candlelight visible through the doorway ahead
  - His track pants and athletic build suggesting readiness to move
  - The hallway stretching before him, shadows seeming slightly wrong
