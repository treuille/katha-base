  - Height order: Henry tallest, Cullan and Arthur same height, then James, then Emer, then baby Hansel

  - Cullan and Arthur standing close but not touching or holding hands
  - Hansel held protectively by Emer - Emer has messy flowing blonde hair
  - All eyes turning toward the living room doorway together
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette perched at the edge of the living room doorway - frozen crimson figurine seeming to beckon them toward the final confrontation
