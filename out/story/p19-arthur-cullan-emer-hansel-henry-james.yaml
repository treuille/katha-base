story_beat: The ornament flares and the spirit erupts, growing huge and blazing
  red. The boys realize it's furious because it's cramped—too big for a bedroom,
  it needs sky!

visual: |
  - The ornament exploding with blazing red light
  - A huge, fierce spirit form erupting from it, filling the room
  - The spirit's face furious, flames and weapons swirling around it
  - All six children recoiling but standing their ground
  - The spirit clearly too big for the space, cramped and angry
