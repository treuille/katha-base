story_beat: James resolves to help and check the stairs. Hansel, satisfied that James
  understands, crawls off toward the sun room. They part ways with purpose—James
  to the stairs, Hansel to whatever awaits in the sun room.

visual:
  - Hansel crawling away toward the sun room, looking back with a determined expression
  - James watching baby Hansel go with resolve
  - James about to head toward the stairs
  - A spark of hope despite the cold, wrong hallway around them
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette peeking from behind a doorframe—frozen crimson figurine almost hidden but watching
  - The hallway still at peak wrongness, but something has shifted—purpose in both their postures
  - James's neon graphic shirt bright even in the blue light, Hansel's nautical print visible
  - Hansel's bottle clutched as he crawls with determination

  "I'll check the stairs," James said. "You be careful, okay?" Hansel bounced once—he would be fine. Then he turned and crawled off toward the sun room, his bottle clutched tight. He had somewhere to be.
