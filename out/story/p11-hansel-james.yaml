story_beat: The realization crystallizes. James looks at the hallway around them,
  at Hansel's calm happiness, at the wrongness everywhere. "This house is haunted."
  Hansel reaches out and grabs James's shirt—solidarity, determination.

visual:
  - James looking around at the warped hallway with new understanding
  - Hansel's small hand gripping James's graphic t-shirt—a moment of connection
  - Both their faces showing a mix of fear and determination
  - The cold blue light and warped geometry emphasizing the weight of the moment
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on window ledge behind them—frozen crimson figurine silhouetted against frosty glass
  - EASTER EGG: James standing in a subtly protective ninja-like stance over Hansel—their ninja training showing instinctively as they face the threat
  - The wrongness visible all around them—tilted frames, pooling shadows
  - United against the haunting, baby and eight-year-old standing together

  James looked at the tilted hallway, the pooling shadows, Hansel's happy clapping still echoing in their mind. "This house is haunted," James said. Hansel grabbed James's shirt and held on tight. They were in this together.
