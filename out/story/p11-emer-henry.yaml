  The realization crystallizes—"This house is haunted." They look at each other
  with a mix of fear and determination. The cold blue light and warped geometry
  emphasize the moment's weight.

visual:
  - Emer and Henry facing each other, the weight of realization on their faces
  - Emer gripping Henry's hand, scared but determined
  - Henry protective but also uncertain—he's the older one but this is beyond normal
  - The hallway at maximum wrongness around them—cold, tilted, shadows deep
  - A moment of fear passing between them, but also resolve building
  - Their breath visible in the cold air
