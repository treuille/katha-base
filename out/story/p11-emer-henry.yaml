  They realize their strengths fit the other's room. Henry the baker will tackle
  the chaotic kitchen. Emer the storyteller will handle the library's scrambled
  bookshelves. They fist bump and head off with purpose.

visual:
  - A spark of hope on both their faces despite the cold hallway
  - Henry pointing toward the kitchen direction, determined
  - Emer pointing toward the library, confident
  - Their body language purposeful and ready
  - A fist bump between the tall teenager and the little girl
  - A faint warm glow beginning at the edges—hope returning
  - Both about to head off to their swapped challenges

  "I'll fix the kitchen," Henry said. "I'm the baker—I know how things are supposed to measure and mix." Emer bounced on her toes. "And I'll fix the library! I know all about how stories are supposed to go!" They bumped fists. Henry headed toward the kitchen. Emer marched toward the library, her pony doll tucked under her arm.
