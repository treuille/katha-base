  The realization crystallizes—this whole house is haunted, and they need to fix
  it room by room. But Henry proved it can be done. They look at each other with
  determination rather than just fear.

visual:
  - Emer and Henry facing each other, determination on their faces
  - Emer gripping Henry's hand, excited now rather than just scared
  - Henry confident and ready—he already fixed one room
  - The hallway still wrong around them, but they're not intimidated
  - Resolve building between them
  - Their breath visible in the cold air, but they're standing tall

  "Henry, you fixed the piano near the bookshelves…" Emer said, her voice getting excited. "If we can fix the kitchen too—" "—then maybe we can fix the whole house," Henry finished. They looked at each other. The hallway was still cold and crooked around them. But they weren't just scared anymore. They had a plan.
