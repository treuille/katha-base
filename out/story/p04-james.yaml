  James walked toward the sunroom. Through the glass doors, they could see the plants—Graminy's ferns and succulents and that orchid she loved. But something was wrong. The plants were moving, swaying without any wind. And was that... whispering? James reached for the door handle. They were good at solving things. Math puzzles, word games, strategy—their brain loved a challenge. Whatever was happening in that sunroom, they'd figure it out.
