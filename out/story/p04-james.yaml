story_beat: James has stepped down into the sunroom and immediately senses something wrong.
  The house is becoming haunted around them. The plants are moving strangely, reaching toward
  nothing, and there's a wrongness in the air that makes James's stomach twist with worry.

visual:
  - James standing INSIDE the sunroom, having just stepped down through the glass doors
  - James is IN the room now—surrounded by Graminy's plants on all sides
  - The plants are MOVING STRANGELY—ferns reaching toward nothing, succulents trembling, vines curling in wrong directions
  - The air feels WRONG—visible distortion, a sense of the house becoming haunted
  - James's expression is WORRIED—brow furrowed, eyes wide with concern, not confident but unsettled
  - The light in the room is strange—greenish, shifting, unnatural
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette visible on a plant shelf—frozen crimson figurine watching from among the leaves
  - EASTER EGG: James's viola case visible through the glass doors behind them—left in the hallway
  - White graphic t-shirt with neon cyan, magenta, yellow design
  - Santa hat still on, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles visible on worried face
  - Cold blue light creeping in at the edges of the room, mixing with the eerie green
  - The glass doors behind James, the hallway visible through them—but James is clearly INSIDE the sunroom now
  - Shadows pooling in corners that shouldn't have shadows

  James stepped down into the sunroom and froze. The plants were wrong. Graminy's ferns reached toward nothing. The succulents trembled. That orchid she loved was twisting slowly, its petals opening and closing like a mouth. The air felt thick, heavy—like the house itself was holding its breath. James's stomach twisted. This wasn't a puzzle. This was something else. Something was happening to Graminy's house, and it was happening right now, all around them.
