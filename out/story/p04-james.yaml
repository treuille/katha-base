story_beat: James follows a strange pull toward another part of the house. The hallway
  feels personally wrong—they've memorized every path in this house, but now the routes
  are lying to them. Doors seem to shift. The map in their head doesn't match what they see.

visual:
  - James standing in the hallway, one hand trailing along the wall as if trying to anchor themselves
  - Their expression is troubled, almost offended—this is their territory and it's betraying them
  - The hallway stretches longer than it should, proportions subtly wrong
  - Doors that should be on the left appear on the right, familiar landmarks in unfamiliar positions
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette tucked behind a picture frame on the hallway wall—frozen crimson figurine with gold crown, completely still
  - Christmas decorations in the hallway look slightly tilted, garland drooping at wrong angles
  - Cold blue light seeping in from somewhere, warm Christmas colors draining away
  - James's breath might frost slightly in the air
  - White graphic t-shirt with neon cyan, magenta, yellow design visible under the cold light
  - Santa hat still on, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles standing out against their concerned face
  - The path ahead seems to fork where it shouldn't—James's mental map is useless here

  James knew this hallway. They had run through it a thousand times—racing Cullan to the kitchen, leading the younger kids in flashlight games, mapping out the perfect route for sardines. But now the hallway was lying. The bathroom door was on the wrong side. The coat closet had moved. James pressed their hand against the wall, feeling for something real, but even the wallpaper felt different—colder, somehow stretched. They had always known exactly where they were going. For the first time, the path itself was wrong.
