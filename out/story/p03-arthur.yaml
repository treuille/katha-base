story_beat: Arthur works on his Rubik's cube, but one ornament on the tree catches
  his attention—it seems to be watching him specifically. Not the others. Just him.
  The cube's colors seem wrong when he's not looking directly at it.

visual: |
  - Arthur sitting cross-legged on the floor, Rubik's cube in his hands
  - His eyes lifting from the cube toward the Christmas tree
  - EASTER EGG: The watching ornament IS Dorje Legpa - a tiny crimson-red deity figurine with gold crown, turquoise sash, and raised sword - its eyes seem to track Arthur specifically
  - The other cousins visible in background, oblivious, but the ornament tracks only Arthur
  - His expression shifting from focused concentration to unease
  - Santa hat slightly tilted as he notices something wrong
  - The Rubik's cube in his hands—colors seeming slightly off, not quite right

  Arthur was three moves from solving his Rubik's cube when something made him look up. One ornament on the tree was watching him. Not anyone else—just him. He glanced back at his cube. Had the colors shifted? No, that was impossible. But when he looked at the tree again, the ornament was still staring. A pattern that didn't fit.
