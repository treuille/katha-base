story_beat: The Scrabble board BOWS to Cullan. The accusations stop. The tiles settle
  peacefully. He stands in the peaceful space and realizes—he doesn't just sense
  fairness. He can COMMAND it. That's real power.

visual:
  - Cullan standing with fierce resolve, arms at his sides, radiating urgent authority
  - Scrabble tiles settled flat on the board, no longer spelling accusations
  - Some tiles oriented toward him in respect, like a small audience
  - The room filling with warm golden light, but cold still lurking at the edges
  - His ice-blue eyes glowing with intensity and worried resolve
  - His expression: triumph mixed with awareness that more challenges lie ahead
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on the windowsill - frozen crimson figurine still present but diminished in the warm golden light

  The Scrabble tiles settled. They lay flat and still, no longer spelling accusations—just letters, waiting for honest words. The board that had twisted Arthur's vocabulary and tried to frame Cullan now sat peaceful and fair. Cullan stood in the warm room, breathing hard, and realized something huge: he didn't just sense what was fair. He could command it. The world had to listen when he spoke the truth. That was power. Real power.
