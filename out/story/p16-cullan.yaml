  The Scrabble tiles settled. They lay flat and still, no longer spelling accusations—just letters, waiting for honest words. The board that had twisted Arthur's vocabulary and tried to frame Cullan now sat peaceful and fair. Cullan stood in the warm room, breathing hard, and realized something huge: he didn't just sense what was fair. He could command it. The world had to listen when he spoke the truth. That was power. Real power.
