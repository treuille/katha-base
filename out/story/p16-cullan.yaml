  The games bowed to him. Chess pieces tilted forward in respect. Dice settled showing honest numbers. The pointing pieces lowered, the accusations stopped. Cullan stood in the peaceful room, breathing hard, and realized something huge: he didn't just sense what was fair. He could command it. The world had to listen when he spoke the truth. That was power. Real power.
