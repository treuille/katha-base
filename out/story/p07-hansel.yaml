story_beat: Hansel gets an idea! He pulls himself up, crawls into a hanging Christmas
  stocking, and uses it as a sled. He bounces happily down the stairs, giggling all
  the way. The haunting recedes as joy fills the stairwell. Pure triumph.

visual:
  - Hansel inside a large Christmas stocking, sliding down the stairs like a sled
  - His face full of pure joy and triumph—giggling, delighted
  - The stocking bumping happily down each step, Hansel bouncing inside
  - The stairs returning to normal size as he descends—haunting receding
  - Visibly warmer atmosphere—golden light returning to the stairwell, the harsh cold receding
  - Medium haunting lingers at the edges—hints of blue at the top of the stairs, geometry normalizing
  - Frost melting on the banister as Hansel slides past, warmth following his joyful descent
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette behind a crystal vase on the landing—frozen crimson figurine diminished
  - The other stockings on the banister showing names: Henry, Cullan, Arthur, Emer, James
  - A moment of pure baby genius and joy

  Then Hansel had an idea. He pulled himself up and looked at the stockings hanging on the banister. He crawled into his own stocking and—WHOOSH! Down he went, bouncing from step to step like a sled. "Wheee!" The stairs shrank back to normal as he giggled past. Stockings make great sleds!
