story_beat: Hansel stops, exhausted. The stockings are fixed—names all correct now.
  But the staircase still loops endlessly. He can't make paths, only rhythms. Someone
  else will need to fix the directions. He crawls away, pointing back at the stairs.

visual:
  - Hansel crawling away from the stairs, looking back over his shoulder
  - His bottle pointing purposefully back at the still-broken staircase
  - All stockings now showing CORRECT names—Hansel's victory visible
  - But the stairs behind him still twist in impossible loops—his limitation clear
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette behind a crystal vase on the landing—frozen crimson figurine watching him leave
  - Hansel's expression determined but knowing—someone else is needed here
  - Visual haunting remains high on the stairs, but stockings glow with restored warmth

  The stockings were fixed. Every name where it belonged. But Hansel couldn't make the stairs go the right way—that wasn't his kind of magic. He crawled toward the hallway, pointing back at the stairs with his bottle. Someone else would have to make the path.
