  Emer steps into the kitchen and sees chaos—jars with wrong labels, ingredients
  swapping places, recipes rewriting themselves on cards. She wants to make
  something, just like she does with mommy. But everything is scrambled.

visual:
  - Emer standing in the kitchen doorway, eyes wide at the chaos before her
  - Jars on counters with labels that don't match their contents—sugar jar filled with salt, flour jar with coffee
  - Recipe cards flutter and shift on the counter, words rearranging themselves
  - Ingredients seem to slide between containers when you're not looking directly at them
  - Peak haunting atmosphere—cold harsh light from windows, pools of darkness in corners, proportions warped and uncanny
  - Kitchen geometry feels wrong—counters seem too tall, distances distorted
  - A unicorn-shaped cookie cutter among the scattered baking tools
  - Tiny Dorje Legpa statuette hiding behind a jar of flour on the counter

  The kitchen was all wrong. Jars had traded labels. Recipe cards kept rewriting themselves. Emer's heart sank—this was where she and Mommy made hot cocoa together. She knew exactly how it should be. "I can fix this," she whispered. "Just like Mommy taught me."
