  The games bowed to him. Chess pieces tilted forward. Dice settled showing honest numbers. The voice that had called him "cheater" went completely silent. Cullan stood in the peaceful room, breathing hard, and realized something huge: he didn't just sense what was fair. He could command it. The world had to listen when he spoke the truth. That was power. Real power.
