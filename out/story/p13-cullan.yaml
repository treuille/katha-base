visual: |
  - Cullan standing triumphant amid now-orderly games
  - All game pieces in their proper boxes, rule cards glowing with fairness
  - The room bathed in warm, peaceful light
  - His ice-blue eyes bright with satisfaction and self-discovery
  - A single die rolling to a stop, showing a fair number at last
