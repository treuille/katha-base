  Cullan rushes toward the playroom with new understanding and newfound power. From ahead, he
  sees Scrabble tiles sliding across the floor, rearranging themselves into
  words. The shadows seem to point accusingly toward the room. But something has awakened in Cullan—
  a fierce sense of justice burning brighter than before.

  - Cullan RUNNING down the hallway toward the playroom with URGENCY and PURPOSE
  - His body in dynamic motion—striding fast with fierce determination, not wary but READY
  - His face shows RESOLVE—ice-blue eyes blazing, jaw clenched, expression of someone who will NOT back down
  - A sense of NEWFOUND MAGICAL POWER radiating from him—his fairness superpower now awakened and burning bright
  - Scrabble tiles visible through the doorway, sliding across the floor
  - Tiles rearranging themselves, spelling fragments of words—but Cullan is UNDETERRED
  - Shadows on the walls seeming to POINT toward the playroom, accusatory—but Cullan points right back with his stride
  - Cold blue light spilling from the playroom, geometry warped
  - His fists clenched at his sides as he moves—ready to fight for what's right
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a narrow wall shelf - frozen crimson figurine with gold crown, watching Cullan approach his challenge

  Cullan ran toward the playroom. Something had changed in the dining room—the fire he'd faced had lit something inside him too. A power. He could feel it now, burning in his chest: the absolute knowledge of what was fair and what wasn't. Through the doorway, he saw Scrabble tiles sliding across the floor, rearranging themselves into cheating words. The shadows pointed at him like accusing fingers. Cullan didn't slow down. "You want to play unfair?" he thought, his eyes blazing. "I was MADE for this."
