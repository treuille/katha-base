  Cullan walks toward the playroom with new understanding. From ahead, he
  sees dice rolling on their own across the floor, game pieces moving in
  aggressive patterns. The shadows seem to point accusingly toward the room.

visual: |
  - Cullan striding down the hallway toward the playroom
  - His posture determined but wary, knowing something waits ahead
  - Dice visible through the doorway, rolling on their own across the floor
  - Game pieces moving in sharp, aggressive patterns
  - Shadows on the walls seeming to POINT toward the playroom, accusatory
  - Ice-blue eyes narrowed with new understanding—this time he knows his real strength
  - Cold blue light spilling from the playroom, geometry warped

  Cullan walked toward the playroom, but slower this time. Through the doorway, he could see dice rolling across the floor on their own—no one touching them. Game pieces moved in sharp, angry patterns. The shadows on the walls seemed to point at the room like accusing fingers. Cullan clenched his fists. Speed wouldn't help here. But unfair games? That, he could fight.
