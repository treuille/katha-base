  Cullan walks toward the playroom with new understanding. From ahead, he
  sees Scrabble tiles sliding across the floor, rearranging themselves into
  words. The shadows seem to point accusingly toward the room.

visual: |
  - Cullan striding down the hallway toward the playroom
  - His posture determined but wary, knowing something waits ahead
  - Scrabble tiles visible through the doorway, sliding across the floor
  - Tiles rearranging themselves, spelling fragments of words
  - Shadows on the walls seeming to POINT toward the playroom, accusatory
  - Ice-blue eyes narrowed with new understanding—this time he knows his real strength
  - Cold blue light spilling from the playroom, geometry warped

  Cullan walked toward the playroom, but slower this time. Through the doorway, he could see Scrabble tiles sliding across the floor on their own—the same game that had attacked Arthur. Letters rearranged themselves into fragments of words. The shadows on the walls seemed to point at the room like accusing fingers. Cullan clenched his fists. Speed wouldn't help here. But unfair games? That, he could fight.
