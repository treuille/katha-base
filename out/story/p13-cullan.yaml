  - Ultra-flat Marin Hanford style with bold colors and magical glow effects
  - Cullan holding a rulebook, words GLOWING and SHIFTING under his gaze
  - His ice-blue eyes are INTENSE, filled with conviction
  - Around him, game pieces are settling into proper places
  - Dice now showing real numbers, cards becoming legitimate
  - One game board shows a completed game—someone finally WON
  - The room exhales: pieces stop trembling, chaos becomes order
  - Golden peaceful light replacing the frustrated darkness
  - Cullan's expression: quiet satisfaction, justice restored
