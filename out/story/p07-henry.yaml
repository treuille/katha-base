story_beat: As Henry plays faster and faster, something magical happens. The piano
  keys begin sliding back into their proper positions. The room de-haunts around him.
  But Henry barely notices—his fingers are flying, he's lost in the pure bliss of
  music, grinning with joy.

visual:
  - Henry playing the old wooden upright piano with pure joy, fingers flying across the keys
  - A blue binder of sheet music open on the music stand, messy stacks of books piled on top of the piano
  - An upright cello on a stand next to the piano
  - The keyboard visibly CORRECTING itself—crooked keys straightening, hovering keys settling down, black and white keys sliding smoothly back into proper positions
  - Musical notes swirling around him in warm golden light
  - The cold blue retreating from the room, replaced by warm golden tones
  - Shadows dissolving, the geometry of the room straightening
  - Henry's face lit up with excitement and bliss, completely lost in the music
  - His goofy grin at full force—he's having the time of his life
  - The library transforming around him, books settling peacefully on shelves
  - Warm light flooding through the windows
  - Santa hat bouncing slightly as he plays with enthusiasm
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on the mantel - frozen crimson figurine seeming smaller, less menacing, as the room returns to normal

  The melody built faster and faster. Henry's fingers flew across the keys, finding harmonies he'd never imagined. And something strange was happening—the keys were moving. Sliding. Rearranging themselves under his hands, slipping back into their proper places. But Henry barely noticed. He was lost in the music, swept up in the pure joy of creation. The cold blue light melted away. Warmth flooded the library. The room was de-haunting around him, but all Henry felt was the music pouring through his fingertips.
