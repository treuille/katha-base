visual:
  - Emer sitting by the Christmas tree, her My Little Pony doll hugged close
  - The tree looking normal and peaceful—no strange ornaments, just simple decorations
  - Her messy flowing blonde hair, beautiful brown eyes soft with wonder
  - A tired but joyful expression—she rode unicorns today and they were real
  - The living room returned to its natural warmth—cozy and unadorned
  - Warm golden light making everything feel like a storybook ending
  - Through the window, soft winter evening settling over the snowy woods
  - Her santa hat, black t-shirt with red heart, pink leggings, white Crocs
  - The sense of a story well-ended, every character in their proper home

  That evening, Emer sat by the tree—the real tree now, no strange ornaments. She held her My Little Pony doll close and smiled a secret smile. The library was quiet now. All the story characters were back where they belonged—the princess in her fairy tale, the dragon in his adventure, every ending matched to the right beginning. And the unicorns... they had been real. They had come when she called. She was just a little girl, but her heart was big enough to believe, and that believing had made something magical come true. Stories needed someone to finish them. And she could do that. She could weave the endings that brought everyone home.
