  Cullan walks toward the playroom with new understanding. From ahead, he
  hears dice rattling on their own. Then a child's voice—not one of his cousins—
  whispers "Your turn. You lose."

visual: |
  - Cullan striding down the hallway toward the playroom
  - His posture determined but wary, knowing something waits ahead
  - Dice visible through the doorway, rattling on their own
  - A ghostly whisper visible as text in the air: "Your turn. You lose."
  - Ice-blue eyes narrowed with new understanding—this time he knows his real strength
  - Light from the playroom casting an ominous glow

  Cullan walked toward the playroom, but slower this time. He could hear dice rattling from inside—rattling on their own, with no one touching them. Then a voice that wasn't any of his cousins whispered from the doorway: "Your turn. You lose." Cullan clenched his fists. Speed wouldn't help here. But unfairness? That, he could fight.
