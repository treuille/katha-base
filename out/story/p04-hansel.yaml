story_beat: Hansel crawls toward the hallway, following the wrongness. The shadows
  move at the wrong speed—out of sync with the light. A grandfather clock ticks
  off-beat. He points urgently with his bottle, but no one sees what he sees.

visual:
  - Hansel as the dominant visual element—large in frame, crawling determinedly
  - His bottle raised, pointing urgently at something adults would miss
  - A grandfather clock visible with its pendulum swinging at a subtly wrong rhythm
  - Shadows on the walls moving at different speeds than they should
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette tucked behind a picture frame—frozen crimson figurine, completely still
  - Cold blue light seeping in, warm Christmas colors draining away
  - Hansel's expression intensely focused, pointing his bottle with purpose

  Hansel crawled toward the hallway. Something was wrong with the shadows—they moved too fast, then too slow. The big clock went tick... tick...... tick. All wrong. He pointed his bottle at the clock, then at the shadows. No one came.
