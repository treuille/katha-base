  Emer follows a strange pull toward another part of the house. The hallway feels
  subtly wrong—warm Christmas colors draining away, replaced by cold blues. Light
  pools oddly. Angles don't quite match up.

visual:
  - Emer walking slowly down the hallway, one hand trailing along the wall for comfort
  - Her bright pink leggings and red heart t-shirt stand out against the increasingly cold blue tones
  - Christmas decorations in the hallway look slightly tilted, proportions off
  - Light pools strangely on the floor, shadows stretching wrong
  - Tiny Dorje Legpa statuette visible on a hallway side table
  - Emer clutches one My Little Pony doll to her chest for comfort

  Emer wandered into the hallway, pulled by something she couldn't name. The Christmas lights seemed dimmer here. The candy canes on the wall hung crooked. Even the floor felt tilted, like the house was holding its breath. She hugged her pony tighter.
