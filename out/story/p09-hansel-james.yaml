  "Something's wrong with the sun room," James said gently, keeping close to Hansel. "The plants keep growing wild. It's like the whole house is... haunted." At that word, Hansel's eyes went wide. He pointed his bottle intently toward the stairs. James followed his gaze, one hand resting protectively on Hansel's shoulder. "You've seen something too, haven't you, buddy?"
