story_beat: Henry makes cupcakes—a whole tray, one for each cousin. As he works, he
  speaks their names, declaring fair distribution with love. He decorates each cupcake
  with a tiny airplane in the icing—his signature, his two passions united. The kitchen
  yields completely. The chaos bows to the chef who cooks for his friends. Warm golden
  light floods back.

visual:
  - Henry placing the last cupcake on a beautiful tray, piping bag in hand
  - Six chocolate cupcakes arranged perfectly, each topped with a tiny airplane design in blue and white icing
  - The airplanes are simple but recognizable—little 747 silhouettes, Henry's signature
  - The kitchen completely transformed—warm golden light everywhere, everything in its proper place
  - Jars lined up neatly, recipe cards lying flat and peaceful, oven gleaming
  - Henry's goofy grin back in full force, pride and warmth radiating from him
  - Steam rising from the fresh cupcakes, filling the air with sweetness
  - His Santa hat slightly dusted with flour, grey tracksuit with a smudge of cocoa—evidence of real work
  - Emer's cup of cocoa still on the counter, now joined by his cupcakes—their victories side by side
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette diminished in a far corner - frozen crimson figurine powerless against this much love and order

  "One for Arthur." Henry piped a tiny airplane in blue icing—a little 747, just like his favorite. "One for Cullan." Another airplane. "One for Emer." He smiled, thinking of her cocoa. "One for Hansel. One for James." He paused at the last one. "And one for me." Six cupcakes. Six airplanes. Six cousins. The kitchen sighed like it had been holding its breath for hours. The chaos bowed. The jars stood at attention. The room belonged to the chef who baked for his friends.
