story_beat: Henry bakes perfect cupcakes—one for each cousin. He follows the recipe
  exactly, measures everything precisely, and the kitchen transforms around him. He
  decorates each cupcake with a tiny airplane in the icing—his signature. The chaos
  surrenders to proper procedure.

visual:
  - Henry placing the last cupcake on a beautiful tray with intense focus, piping bag in hand
  - Six chocolate cupcakes arranged perfectly, each topped with a tiny airplane design in blue and white icing
  - The airplanes are simple but recognizable—little 747 silhouettes, Henry's signature
  - The kitchen transforming—warm golden light pushing back the cold, order returning
  - Measuring cups cleaned and put away, recipe followed perfectly
  - The fridge to the right of the dishwasher, both gleaming and orderly
  - Henry's expression: triumphant but still worried—he's winning but the danger isn't fully passed
  - Steam rising from the fresh cupcakes, filling the air with sweetness
  - His Santa hat slightly dusted with flour, grey tracksuit with a smudge of cocoa—evidence of urgent work
  - The disgusting chaos bowl nowhere to be seen—proper baking has replaced it
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette diminished in a far corner - frozen crimson figurine weakened but still present

  "One for Arthur." Henry piped a tiny airplane in blue icing—a little 747, just like his favorite. "One for Cullan. One for Emer. One for Hansel. One for James." He paused at the last one. "And one for me." Six cupcakes. Six airplanes. Six cousins. Each ingredient measured perfectly. Each step followed in order. The kitchen glowed warm and golden. The chaos was gone. Proper procedure had won.
