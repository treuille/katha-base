  - Looking up at the canopy of enormous leaves above him with intense focus
  - His small body showing courage—this is a deliberate, resolved choice in the face of danger
  - The massive plants still looming threateningly around him
  - A wooden table nearby with the board game "Ravine" visible on it
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a shelf—frozen crimson figurine peering down at the small figure below
  - Darkness still dominant, the threat not yet passed
  - His Santa hat slightly askew, bottle beside him on the floor
  - His baby face showing worried resolve—he's doing something important even though it's scary

  But then Hansel did something strange. He crawled right into the jungle. He lay down on his back and looked up at all the big leaves above him. He took a deep breath. The plants were so tall and wild. But lying here, looking up... it was kind of wonderful.
