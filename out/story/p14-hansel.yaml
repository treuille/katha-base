story_beat: The sun room has become a jungle. The plants have grown huge and wild,
  their leaves and vines stretching toward the ceiling, blocking out the light. The
  room is cast in deep shadow. Hansel stops in the doorway, frightened.

visual:
  - Hansel in the sun room doorway, frozen with fear
  - Plants grown enormous—ferns towering, vines stretching across the ceiling
  - The jungle of vegetation blocking the windows, casting the room in darkness
  - Only slivers of light visible through gaps in the dense foliage
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette barely visible through the jungle growth—frozen crimson figurine watching from the shadows
  - Dark, threatening atmosphere—the familiar sun room transformed into wilderness
  - Hansel's face showing genuine fear—this is overwhelming
