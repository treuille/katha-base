story_beat: The sun room attacks Hansel's identity. His happy claps echo back distorted
  and harsh. Plants recoil from him. The room accuses him—his sounds are CAUSING
  the chaos, not helping. His joy is framed as destruction.

visual:
  - Hansel in the sun room doorway, his clap frozen mid-motion
  - Sound waves visible around him—his claps echoing back distorted, jagged, wrong
  - Plants visibly recoiling from his presence, leaves curling away
  - Seasons flickering violently through the windows—dawn, dusk, noon, all at once
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a plant stand—frozen crimson figurine watching the false accusations unfold
  - Harsh cold light, shadows pointing accusingly at Hansel from all angles
  - Hansel's face showing hurt and confusion—his joy being weaponized against him

  Hansel clapped—and the sound came back wrong. Harsh. Broken. The plants curled away from him. The light flickered faster. The room seemed to say: YOU did this. Your noise broke everything. Hansel's lip trembled. Was his joy really just chaos?
