  Henry describes what happened in the library—books with scrambled stories,
  characters wandering between pages, endings that won't stay put. Emer listens
  with wide eyes, recognizing the same kind of wrongness.

visual:
  - Henry gesturing as he describes the library chaos
  - Ghost-like transparent overlays between them showing scrambled book pages, wandering characters
  - Emer's eyes wide with recognition—she understands this kind of problem
  - Henry's expression frustrated—he tried to organize but it didn't fully work
  - The cold hallway around them, light pooling strangely
  - Tiny Dorje Legpa statuette visible on a side table

  "The library's haunted too," Henry said. "Books with mixed-up stories. Characters walking into the wrong books. I tried shelving them right, but..." He shook his head. Emer's eyes went wide. Scrambled stories? Characters in wrong places? That sounded like something she understood.
