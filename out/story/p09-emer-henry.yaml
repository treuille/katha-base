  Henry excitedly tells Emer about his piano discovery. The keys were flying off at crooked
  angles, hovering and tilted—complete madness—so he invented a new melody that worked with
  the chaos—and the room fixed itself! Emer listens with wide eyes.

visual:
  - Henry gesturing excitedly as he describes his piano victory
  - Ghost-like transparent overlays showing the old wooden upright piano with keys at crooked angles, some hovering, then sliding back into place—a blue binder of sheet music on the stand, messy stacks of books on top, an upright cello on a stand beside it
  - Emer's eyes wide with amazement, hugging her pony doll tight—Henry figured something out!
  - Henry's expression excited and proud
  - Medium haunting atmosphere—cold blue tones emerging, harsh shadows, geometry slightly off
  - Tiny Dorje Legpa statuette visible on a side table

  "The library piano had gone completely mad," Henry said excitedly. "Keys were sticking out at crazy angles—some hovering in the air, black and white keys all jumbled together! But I didn't try to fix it—I played WITH it. I invented a new melody, and the faster I played, the more the piano fixed ITSELF!" He grinned. "The whole room went back to normal!" He paused. "But the bookshelves did seem a bit weird…" Emer's eyes went wide.
