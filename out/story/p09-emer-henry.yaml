  Henry excitedly tells Emer about his piano discovery. The keys were all scrambled,
  so he invented a new melody that worked with the chaos—and the room fixed itself!
  Emer listens with wide eyes.

  - Ghost-like transparent overlays showing piano keys rearranging, musical notes swirling
  - Emer's eyes wide with amazement, hugging her pony doll tight—Henry figured something out!
  - Henry's expression excited and proud
  - The hallway around them, slightly warmer than before
  - Tiny Dorje Legpa statuette visible on a side table

  "The library piano was all scrambled," Henry said excitedly. "The keys were in completely wrong places! But I didn't try to fix it—I played WITH it. I invented a new melody, and the faster I played, the more the piano fixed ITSELF!" He grinned. "The whole room went back to normal!" He paused. "But the bookshelves did seem a bit weird…" Emer's eyes went wide.
