story_beat: Arthur enters the playroom and sees chaos—scattered games, pieces
  everywhere. But his eyes are drawn to a Scrabble board with a game in progress.
  No players. Letters arranged in words. He sits down, confident. He's a tournament
  player. He knows every word.

  - Arthur's expression: relief, happiness, triumph—despite the chaos around him, THIS he knows
  - Moving eagerly toward the Scrabble board, his domain
  - Cold blue light seeping through windows despite the mess
  - His posture straightening—this is something he understands

  The playroom was chaos. Board games scattered everywhere, chess pieces on the floor, cards flung like confetti. But in the center of it all sat a Scrabble board, mid-game, with no one playing. Arthur felt his confidence return. Scrabble he understood. He'd beaten adults at tournaments. He sat down and studied the board. Time to show this room who knew words.
