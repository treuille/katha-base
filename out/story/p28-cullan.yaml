visual:
  - Cullan sitting by the Christmas tree, his ice-blue eyes thoughtful
  - The tree looking normal and peaceful—no strange ornaments, just simple decorations
  - His hands resting on his knees, palms up—the hands that commanded fairness
  - A quiet, contemplative expression—he's discovered something profound about himself
  - The living room returned to its natural warmth—cozy and real, no lingering wrongness
  - Warm golden light, the room feeling honest and true
  - Through the window, peaceful winter evening in the snowy woods
  - His santa hat, tousled curly dark blonde hair, shy but confident posture
  - The sense of truth spoken and heard, balance restored

  That evening, Cullan sat by the tree—the real tree now, no strange ornaments. Just a normal Christmas tree in a normal living room. He looked at his hands. Earlier today, those hands had been fast enough to blow out candles. But that wasn't what had saved the playroom. What saved it was his voice. His truth. When he'd said what was fair, the room had listened. He'd always known when something was rigged, when rules were unfair. But now he knew something more: he could speak, and the world would straighten itself out. That was worth more than speed.
