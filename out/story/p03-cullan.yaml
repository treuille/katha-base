story_beat: The main character plays with their favorite toy, glances at the tree, and feels a subtle sense that something about it is wrong.

# This should be a few bullet points, each just a few words or a relatively simple sentences long. It will be used as input into the prompt engine.
# DO NOT: Copy / replicate / duplicate any visual information from

# It should frame a single dramatic image and a single moment in time which makes sense with the story text.
