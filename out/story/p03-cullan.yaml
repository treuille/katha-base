visual: |
  - Ultra-flat Marin Hanford style with bold colors and clean graphic shapes
  - Cullan sits cross-legged on the floor, laptop open, blue light from Fortnite on his face
  - His ice-blue eyes lift from the screen toward the Christmas tree
  - On the laptop screen, the game appears slightly glitched—frozen mid-action
  - The strange ornament on the tree catches light oddly, drawing his suspicious gaze
  - Warm living room colors contrast with the cool blue of his screen
