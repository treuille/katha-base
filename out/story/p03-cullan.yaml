  him.

  - Cullan sitting cross-legged with black gaming laptop, Fortnite glowing on screen
  - His ice-blue eyes lifting from the game toward the Christmas tree
  - EASTER EGG: The watching ornament IS Dorje Legpa - a tiny crimson-red deity figurine with gold crown, turquoise sash, and raised sword - its eyes seem to track Cullan specifically
  - The other cousins visible in background, oblivious, but the ornament tracks only Cullan
  - His expression shifting from relaxed to unsettled, a chill running through him
  - Santa hat slightly askew as he tilts his head, feeling singled out

  Cullan was deep in a Fortnite match when something made him look up. One ornament on the tree seemed to be staring at him. Not at anyone else—just him. The other kids kept playing, oblivious. But that ornament... it was watching. A chill ran down his spine.
