  Emer sinks down, overwhelmed, and cries out—a genuine cry of distress from her
  heart. The library door swings open. Unicorns gallop through, drawn by her pure
  cry. They heard her because she truly believes. The lead unicorn kneels gently
  before her.

visual:
  - Emer on her knees in the library, tears on her cheeks, crying out
  - The library door swinging wide open behind her
  - Unicorns galloping through the doorway—white and silver, manes flowing, magical
  - They emerge from the space between stories, drawn by her genuine distress
  - The lead unicorn already kneeling down to her level, gentle eyes meeting hers
  - Light shifting—the cold blue interrupted by warm magical glow from the unicorns
  - Emer's expression transforming from despair to wonder
  - Her My Little Pony doll on the floor beside her—her belief made real
