  Emer reached for the glowing book. The moment she touched it, a unicorn rose from the pages—white and silver, mane flowing like starlight. A real unicorn. She was entranced, enraptured, trembling. It was everything she'd ever dreamed. She reached up, fingers stretching toward its shimmering coat. "You're real," she whispered. "You're actually real."
