  Emer plays with her My Little Pony dolls, but something about the tree catches
  her attention—an ornament seems to be watching her specifically, singling her
  out from the others. A chill runs through her.

visual:
  - Emer frozen mid-play on the carpet, My Little Pony dolls scattered around her in mid-gallop formation
  - She looks up at the tree with wide, startled brown eyes
  - The strange ornament glows faintly, its reflection visible in her eyes
  - Her santa hat slightly askew from playing
  - Warm golden light beginning to drain at the edges of the frame, hints of cold blue creeping in

  Emer made her ponies gallop across the carpet, singing their adventures. But something on the tree caught her eye—an ornament she'd never seen before. It seemed to watch her. Just her. A chill ran through her, and the ponies stopped mid-gallop.
