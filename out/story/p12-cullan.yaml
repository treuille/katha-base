story_beat: Instead of playing by the rigged rules, Cullan stops and speaks with
  authority. He DECLARES what fair means—not with a pen, but with his voice. "A fair
  game is one where everyone can win." The room begins to listen.

  - His ice-blue eyes glowing with authority and conviction
  - Visible words emanating from his mouth like power: "A FAIR GAME..."

  - His expression fierce, commanding, discovering his real power

  Cullan stopped trying to play. He stood up tall and spoke out loud: "A fair game is one where everyone can win." The room went quiet. "A fair game doesn't have hidden rules." The floating accusations wavered. "A fair game lets you make mistakes without being destroyed." His voice rang with authority—and the games began to listen.
