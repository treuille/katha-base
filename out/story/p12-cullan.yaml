story_beat: The main character experiments with a solution based on that passion,
  and the room begins to respond and improve.

visual: |
  - Cullan kneeling among the games, picking up rule cards
  - His hands physically rewriting rules on the cards with a found pen
  - Some games already responding—pieces settling into proper positions
  - A warm glow beginning to emanate from the corrected games
  - His expression focused, almost meditative, deeply concentrated

  Cullan grabbed a pen and started rewriting. "Roll doubles, move again—but only twice." Fair. "Bankrupt players get a second chance." Fair. "Winner helps the loser set up the next game." As each rule became just, the games began to glow softly.
