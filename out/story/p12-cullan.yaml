visual: |
  - Ultra-flat illustration style with bold graphic shapes and clean edges
  - Cullan kneeling among scattered game pieces, testing them
  - He rolls dice—they come up BLANK, showing nothing
  - He tries a card game—the deck fans out revealing ALL JOKERS
  - His expression shifts from testing to ANGER—righteous, not scared
  - His ice-blue eyes go intense, focused, determined
  - The room feels deliberately wrong—this isn't chaos, it's CHEATING
  - Flat bold colors emphasize the injustice: wrong numbers, impossible cards
