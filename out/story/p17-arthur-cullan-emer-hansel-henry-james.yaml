story_beat: Henry points at the odd ornament on the tree, drawing everyone's
  attention to it.

visual: |
  - Ultra-flat illustration style with bold graphic shapes and dramatic focus
  - Henry's arm extended, pointing directly at the strange ornament
  - All other children's gazes following his finger to the tree
  - The ornament isolated visually—other decorations fade, this one GLOWS
  - The ornament looks ancient, out of place among cheerful Christmas decorations
  - Tension in everyone's posture—this is the source
  - Flat colors with dramatic contrast: dark ornament against bright tree

  "There." Henry pointed at an ornament near the top. It was different from the others—darker, older, with strange patterns that seemed to move. "That one. That's what's wrong."
