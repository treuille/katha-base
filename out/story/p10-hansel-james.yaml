  showing their dawning realization and rising concern.

visual:
  - James looking around at the warped hallway with new understanding
  - Hansel's small hand gripping James's graphic t-shirt—a moment of connection
  - Both their faces showing a mix of fear and determination
  - The cold blue light and warped geometry emphasizing the weight of the moment
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on window ledge behind them—frozen crimson figurine silhouetted against frosty glass
  - EASTER EGG: James standing in a subtly protective ninja-like stance over Hansel—their ninja training showing instinctively as they face the threat
  - The wrongness visible all around them—tilted frames, pooling shadows
  - United against the haunting, baby and eight-year-old standing together
