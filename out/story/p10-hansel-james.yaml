story_beat: Hansel demonstrates his rhythm. TAP-tap-tap, TAP-tap-tap. He points at
  his chest, then at the sun room direction. James watches the pattern, something
  clicking in their mind. They're comparing experiences—and finding connections.

visual:
  - Hansel clapping in clear rhythm—TAP-tap-tap visible in his posture and motion
  - James watching intently, head tilted, beginning to understand something
  - Hansel pointing sequence: chest (me), then toward sun room (there), then clapping (rhythm)
  - Ghostly overlays around them—looping stairs for Hansel, flickering plants for James
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette tucked behind a potted plant in corner—frozen crimson figurine barely visible between leaves
  - The visual wrongness at peak around them, but a spark of understanding forming
  - James's expression shifting from confusion to dawning realization

  Hansel showed James what he meant. TAP-tap-tap. TAP-tap-tap. He pointed at himself, then toward where the sun room was, then clapped again. James watched the rhythm. "You... you kept making a beat," James said slowly.
