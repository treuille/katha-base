visual:
  - NOTE: Expressions should be INTENTLY CONCERNED, NOT angry—focused and worried, but not mad
  - Hansel pointing with his bottle—first toward stairs, then toward sun room
  - James kneeling to watch baby Hansel—his face intently concerned, not angry
  - James's expression shifting to understanding—Hansel is communicating!
  - Hansel's cute, intent face showing determination—focused but not upset
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette tucked behind a potted plant in corner—frozen crimson figurine barely visible between leaves
  - The visual wrongness at peak around them, but a spark of understanding forming
  - A moment of connection between the cousins

  Hansel pointed his bottle at the stairs. Then at the sun room. Then back at the stairs. James watched, thinking. "You want me to check the stairs? And you'll go to the sun room?" Hansel bounced happily—yes! That was exactly it.
