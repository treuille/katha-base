story_beat: Cullan stops fighting and shouts at the flames—"It's not fair to burn
  someone's house down!" Something strange happens. The flames flicker, hesitate,
  then shrink back. His words had power. He doesn't understand it yet, but he
  felt something respond to him. He needs to find Arthur.

visual: |
  - Cullan standing tall, shouting at the flames with fierce determination
  - The flames on the curtains HESITATING, shrinking back from his words
  - His expression showing surprise—his words did something
  - Candles still clustered but the fire retreating
  - Visibly warmer atmosphere than before—golden light returning around Cullan, the harsh cold receding
  - Medium haunting lingers at the edges—hints of blue at the corners, geometry still slightly off
  - A thin line of frost remains on the far windows, but melting near Cullan
  - His ice-blue eyes wide with realization—something responded to him
  - His santa hat askew, sweat on his brow, but a new confidence emerging
  - The burned curtains still smoking but no longer actively burning
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette behind a crystal vase on the mantel - frozen crimson figurine seeming to nod slightly at Cullan's discovery

  Cullan stopped, gasping for breath. Speed wasn't working. The flames kept spreading no matter how fast he moved. "It's not fair!" he shouted at the fire. "It's not fair to burn someone's house down!" And something strange happened. The flames flickered. Hesitated. Then slowly—impossibly—they shrank back from the curtains. Cullan stared. His words had done something. He didn't understand it, but he felt the fire respond to him. He needed to find Arthur—something very weird was happening here.
