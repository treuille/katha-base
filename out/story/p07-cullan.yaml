story_beat: The room calms down a bit and the haunting is visibly weakened, but
  something still feels off as the main character leaves.

visual: |
  - Cullan standing back, slightly winded, surveying his work
  - All candles now burning steadily, the wild flickering stopped
  - But the chairs and place settings still scrambled, unchanged
  - His expression shifting from triumph to puzzlement
  - Looking back over his shoulder as he heads toward the door
