visual: |
  - Cullan standing back, breathing hard, surveying the room
  - Candles still clustered dangerously despite his best efforts
  - His expression shifting from frustration to defeat
  - The room still dominated by cold harsh light, angles wrong
  - High haunting—deep shadows, warped geometry, cold blue dominant
  - His ice-blue eyes showing he knows speed won't solve this
  - Turning toward the door, needing to find help
  - His santa hat askew, sweat on his brow

  Cullan stopped, gasping for breath. The candles were still clustering in their dangerous corner, flames reaching for the curtains. No matter how fast he moved, they slid right back. Speed wasn't working. Whatever was wrong here, it wasn't something he could outrun. He needed to find Arthur—maybe his best friend would know what to do.
