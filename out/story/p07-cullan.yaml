story_beat: The candles hold, but Cullan's place is still erased. He realizes speed
  can't make people want you there. He leaves, knowing his obvious skill wasn't the
  right tool. The room needs someone who can see what's unfair.

visual: |
  - Cullan standing back, breathing hard, surveying the table
  - All candles burning steadily—his speed worked for that
  - But his plate still empty, his chair pushed away, his placecard blank
  - His expression shifting from confusion to painful realization
  - Looking back at the empty spot where he should belong
  - The bitter understanding that speed can't fix this

  The candles held. Cullan had won that battle. But his place at the table was still gone—blank card, pushed-away chair, no sign he'd ever belonged there. Speed could keep flames lit, but it couldn't make people want him. He turned toward the hallway, a lump in his throat. This room needed something he couldn't give it.
