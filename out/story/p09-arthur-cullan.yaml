story_beat: Arthur describes what happened in his room—the Scrabble board that
  twisted his words. He played SYZYGY and the letters changed. The hallway around
  them feels frozen, light harsh and wrong.

  - Arthur now gesturing, describing his experience
  - Cullan listening, nodding with recognition
  - Ghostly transparent overlay showing Arthur's experience: Scrabble tiles twisting, letters rearranging
  - The hallway still at peak wrongness - cold, harsh shadows
  - Arthur's Rubik's cube visible in his pocket
  - Both boys' breath frosting in the cold air
  - Light pooling in wrong places around them

  Arthur's eyes went wide. "The playroom too! I found a Scrabble board and played SYZYGY—you know, the astronomy word? The letters twisted right after I placed them. Turned into gibberish. Made me look like a cheater!" His voice cracked. "I've beaten adults at Scrabble. And this game rejected me."
