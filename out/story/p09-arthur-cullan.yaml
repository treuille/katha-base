location: hallway

story_beat: Arthur describes what happened in his room—games that kept changing their
  own rules, rigging themselves against him. The hallway around them feels frozen,
  light harsh and wrong.

visual: |
  - Arthur now gesturing, describing his experience
  - Cullan listening, nodding with recognition
  - Ghostly transparent overlay showing Arthur's experience: scattered game pieces, board games with rules rewriting themselves
  - The hallway still at peak wrongness - cold, harsh shadows
  - Arthur's Rubik's cube visible in his pocket
  - Both boys' breath frosting in the cold air
  - Light pooling in wrong places around them

  Arthur's eyes went wide. "The playroom too! Every game I touched changed its own rules. Chess pieces moved when I looked away. The dice kept rolling wrong. It's like everything was rigged against me!"
