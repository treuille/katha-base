story_beat: James plays on their Nintendo Switch, but they keep glancing at the clock—no
  morning puzzles today because it's Christmas. The Dorje Legpa ornament catches their
  eye. It doesn't just watch them—it seems to dare them. Like it's saying "try to lead
  your way out of this."

visual:
  - James sitting on the couch with their Nintendo Switch, but their attention is drifting
  - Their eyes keep flicking toward the Christmas tree, expression shifting from relaxed to unsettled
  - EASTER EGG: The watching ornament IS Dorje Legpa - a tiny crimson-red deity figurine with gold crown, turquoise sash, and raised sword - its eyes seem to track James specifically, almost daring them
  - The ornament has an almost mocking quality, challenging James's sense of control
  - White crew neck t-shirt with large vibrant graphic print featuring abstract shapes and graffiti-style lettering in cyan, magenta, and yellow
  - Black sweatpants, bare feet tucked under them on the couch
  - Santa hat slightly askew on their ginger red hair with the distinctive blonde highlight streak at the front
  - Prominent freckles visible on their nose and cheeks, forceful smiley expression now fading to unease
  - The other cousins visible in background playing happily, but the ornament tracks only James
  - Warm golden light beginning to drain at the edges, hints of cold blue creeping in
  - A clock visible somewhere in the room—James's morning routine disrupted

  James wasn't really playing. Their thumbs moved on the Switch, but their mind was somewhere else. No Spelling Bee this morning. No Wordle. Christmas had scrambled the routine. Then they saw the ornament. It hung near the top of the tree, crimson and gold, and it was looking right at them. Not just watching—daring. James had led games through this house a hundred times. They knew every path, every hiding spot, every shortcut. But this ornament seemed to say: try to find your way out of this one. James looked back at the screen. Their character had walked off a cliff. They decided to look around the house.
