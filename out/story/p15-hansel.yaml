story_beat: Hansel stops. He doesn't fight the accusation with words—he has none.
  Instead, he simply offers his true rhythm. TAP-tap-tap. Genuine. Joyful. Pure.
  The nearest plant pauses mid-flicker. It listens. Warm golden light begins returning.

visual:
  - Hansel sitting still in the center of the sun room, eyes closed in concentration
  - His hands positioned in a gentle, steady clap—not defensive, just offering rhythm
  - The nearest plant frozen mid-flicker, a fern pausing between seasons to listen
  - Warm golden tones beginning to seep back in at the edges of the frame
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a shelf—frozen crimson figurine seeming to lean back as Hansel's genuine rhythm fills the room
  - The harsh cold beginning to retreat, warmth returning
  - Hansel's face peaceful, certain—his joy is real and he knows it

  Hansel stopped. He couldn't argue—he was just a baby. But he knew his joy was real. He closed his eyes and clapped. TAP-tap-tap. Soft. True. The fern beside him paused. Stopped flickering. Listened. The light began to warm.
