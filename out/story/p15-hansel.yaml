  tangle of leaves above him. He takes a deep breath.

  - Hansel lying on his back in the middle of the overgrown sun room
  - Looking up at the canopy of enormous leaves above him
  - His body relaxed, no longer tense with fear
  - The massive plants looming around him but Hansel calm beneath them
  - A wooden table nearby with the board game "Ravine" visible on it
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a shelf—frozen crimson figurine peering down at the small figure below
  - Darkness still dominant but Hansel peaceful in the shadows
  - His Santa hat slightly askew, bottle beside him on the floor

  But then Hansel did something strange. He crawled right into the jungle. He lay down on his back and looked up at all the big leaves above him. He took a deep breath. The plants were so tall and wild. But lying here, looking up... it was kind of wonderful.
