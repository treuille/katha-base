story_beat: Henry leaves the kitchen carrying his tray of cupcakes. The kitchen and
  library are both fixed now. But the house still feels wrong elsewhere. He needs
  to find his cousins and share his cupcakes.

visual:
  - Henry in the hallway, carefully balancing the tray of six cupcakes with airplane decorations
  - His expression proud but alert—two rooms fixed, but the house isn't done yet
  - The hallway still slightly wrong—not as bad as before, but something lingers
  - Warm light from the kitchen behind him, but cold blue still lurking ahead
  - His tall figure moving with purpose, protective of the cupcakes
  - Santa hat back in place, flour dust on his grey tracksuit
  - The cupcakes glowing warm on the tray, little airplanes visible on each one
  - His eyes looking toward where he senses the others might be
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a decorative shelf near a doorway - frozen crimson figurine still watching even as victories accumulate

  Henry stepped into the hallway, cupcakes balanced carefully on the tray. The kitchen behind him felt warm and right again—just like the piano. Two rooms fixed. But something still pulsed through the rest of the house—a deeper wrongness in the walls, the floor, the too-cold air. He started walking, keeping the cupcakes steady. He needed to find his cousins. They were definitely going to need these cupcakes.
