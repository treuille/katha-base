story_beat: Henry points at the odd ornament on the tree, drawing everyone's
  attention to it.

visual: |
  - Henry pointing directly at a strange ornament on the tree
  - The ornament IS Dorje Legpa - crimson-red deity figurine with gold crown, turquoise sash, tiny raised sword, now glowing with an unsettling inner light
  - All other cousins turning to look where he points
  - The Dorje Legpa ornament distinctly different from the others—wrong and pulsing with energy
  - Tension building in the frame as all eyes focus on the deity figurine

  "There." Henry's voice was steady as he pointed at the tree. One ornament hung slightly crooked, glowing with a strange inner light that didn't match the others. It seemed to pulse, almost breathing. "That's what's wrong."
