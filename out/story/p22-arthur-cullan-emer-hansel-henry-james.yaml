story_beat: Close-up on Regan's face as she recognizes it—shocked, worried, and
  surprised in a funny way. Behind her, rainbows, deities, lotuses, and other
  Buddhist imagery shimmer in the air as she realizes what the ornament contains.
  She identifies it as Dorje Legpa, a Gyalpo trickster deity whose nature is
  to scramble things.

  - Close-up on Regan's face showing shock, worry, and bemused recognition
  - Regan is a beautiful 45-year-old woman with great skin and figure - mature adult features, NOT youthful or teenager-like
  - Her expression shows she almost wants to laugh at the absurdity
  - Behind her, translucent Buddhist imagery shimmering: rainbows, lotuses, deity figures
  - The children watching her reaction with wide eyes
  - The strange ornament reflected in her eyes
  - A mix of alarm and "oh no, not this again" humor in her expression

  Regan walked in and froze. Her eyes went wide, then narrowed. "Oh no." Behind her, strange images shimmered—rainbows, lotuses, fierce deities. "That's Dorje Legpa. A Gyalpo spirit. A trickster." She almost laughed. "He always scrambles everything up."
