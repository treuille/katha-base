story_beat: Cullan and Arthur ride in the sled being dragged by the airplane, holding the deity in a box. Emer trails behind on a tricycle with Hansel on the handlebars, pointing exultantly at the sky with his bottle. The plane lifts the sled—not too high, just enough for comedic effect—dragging it across the lawn, up over a little bump, maybe through some clouds.

  The airplane lifted the sled—not too high, just enough. Cullan and Arthur rode it, holding the deity's box. Emer trailed behind on a tricycle with Hänsel on the handlebars. He pointed at the sky with his bottle, laughing. They dragged the spirit across the lawn, up through the clouds.
