story_beat: Cullan and Arthur ride in the sled being dragged by the airplane,
  holding the deity in a box. Emer trails behind on a tricycle with Hansel on
  the handlebars, pointing exultantly at the sky with his bottle. The plane
  lifts the sled—not too high, just enough for comedic effect—dragging it across
  the lawn, up over a little bump, maybe through some clouds.

  - Ultra-flat Marin Hanford style with MAXIMUM comedic energy and bold colors
  - Henry's airplane pulling the red sled through the air—not too high!
  - CULLAN AND ARTHUR in the sled, holding a box with the wiggling spirit inside
  - The sled bouncing over a snowy bump, catching a little air
  - EMER on a tricycle behind them, pedaling furiously
  - HANSEL on the handlebars, pointing at the sky with his bottle, EXULTANT
  - James still on ground directing traffic
  - Wispy clouds, blue sky, white snow—pure joy and absurdity
  - Flat bold colors celebrating the ridiculous triumph

  The plane lifted the sled—just a little!—and dragged it across the lawn. Cullan and Arthur held the spirit's box tight as they bounced over a snowy bump. Behind them, Emer pedaled a tricycle with Hansel on the handlebars, pointing his bottle at the sky and laughing.
