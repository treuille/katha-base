visual: |
  - Both boys facing each other, expressions shifting from fear to thought
  - Arthur and Cullan are the same height, standing eye-to-eye
  - The cold blue hallway surrounding them, geometry still warped
  - Both gesturing as they compare stories
  - Visual elements: candle flames on one side, Scrabble tiles twisting on the other
  - Their faces showing the beginning of understanding
  - Peak haunting atmosphere - shadows deep, light harsh, angles wrong
  - The sense that something bigger is connecting their experiences
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette tucked behind a potted plant in the corner - frozen crimson figurine barely visible between the leaves
