story_beat: They compare notes, realizing the connections between their experiences.
  A dawning understanding begins—something is very wrong with this house. The visual
  wrongness is at its peak around them.

visual:
  - NOTE: Expressions should be INTENTLY CONCERNED, NOT angry—focused and worried, but not mad
  - "IMPORTANT: Show CULLAN on the LEFT side of frame with his tousled curly DARK BLONDE hair. Show ARTHUR on the RIGHT side of frame with his messy curly BROWN hair."
  - Both boys facing each other, expressions shifting from fear to thought—intently concerned, not angry
  - Arthur and Cullan are the same height, standing eye-to-eye
  - The cold blue hallway surrounding them, geometry still warped
  - Both gesturing as they compare stories
  - Visual elements: candle flames on one side, Scrabble tiles twisting on the other
  - Their faces showing the beginning of understanding—worried and focused
  - Peak haunting atmosphere - shadows deep, light harsh, angles wrong
  - The sense that something bigger is connecting their experiences
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette tucked behind a potted plant in the corner - frozen crimson figurine barely visible between the leaves

  "Wait," Cullan said slowly. "Things keep moving on their own in your room. Things keep moving on their own in mine." He looked down the hallway—was that doorframe crooked? "Arthur... do you feel like the house itself is wrong?"
