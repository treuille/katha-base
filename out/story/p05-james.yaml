story_beat: James opens the glass doors and steps down into the sunroom. Immediately,
  the plants shift to block the path. Vines stretch across the way, ferns lean in,
  and a large monstera unfurls its leaves like a barrier. A whisper rises from the
  greenery—numbers, equations, impossible sums floating in the air.

  James stepped down into the sunroom. Instantly, the plants moved. Vines stretched across the path. Ferns leaned in. The big monstera spread its leaves like a wall. "You cannot pass," the plants whispered together, "until you solve the impossible sums." Numbers appeared in the air, glowing among the leaves. Long multiplication. Square roots. Tricky fractions. James grinned. Math. Now this was something they could do.
