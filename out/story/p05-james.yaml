story_beat: James enters the sun room and finds chaos—plants blooming and wilting in
  seconds, sunlight flickering between dawn and dusk, seasons scrambled. A fern freezes
  in winter while a succulent bakes in summer, all in the same room at once.

visual:
  - James standing in the doorway of the sun room, eyes wide at the temporal chaos
  - The sun room is a greenhouse-like space with many windows, filled with plants
  - Plants in visible distress—some blooming frantically, others wilting, leaves changing color in real-time
  - Sunlight streaming through windows but flickering—golden morning light in one pane, orange sunset in another, harsh noon in a third
  - A fern covered in frost while inches away a cactus droops in summer heat
  - Shadows moving wrong, not matching the light sources
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a plant stand among the pots—frozen crimson figurine watching the chaos unfold, gold details catching the flickering light
  - Cold blue tones from winter-light mixing with harsh yellows from summer-light
  - James's graphic t-shirt with neon colors almost glowing in the strange mixed light
  - Santa hat, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles, forceful expression becoming determined
  - James's hands already reaching toward the nearest plant, instinct to organize kicking in

  The sun room was supposed to be Graminy's peaceful place—ferns and succulents and that one orchid she was so proud of. But now it was chaos. Through one window, James saw dawn. Through another, blazing noon. A third showed deep winter dusk. The fern was covered in frost. The cactus was wilting in heat. Flowers bloomed and died in seconds, petals scattering like snow. Time itself was scrambled here. James stepped inside. "Okay," they said to no one. "This needs organizing."
