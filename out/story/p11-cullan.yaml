  - Ultra-flat Marin Hanford style—bold colors, graphic shapes, no 3D depth
  - Devastation scene: the playroom looks like a FROZEN TANTRUM
  - Monopoly money crumpled and scattered across the floor
  - Chess pieces knocked over mid-game, some thrown against walls
  - Dice showing blank faces, cards torn and scattered
  - A Connect Four board with ALL pieces the same color
  - Chairs overturned as if players stormed off in fury
  - Cullan stands in the doorway, taking in the scene of rage
  - His expression shifts from shock to recognition—he understands this feeling
