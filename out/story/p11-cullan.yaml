story_beat: The playroom attacks Cullan in a new way—not erasing him, but framing him.
  Every game is rigged so HE looks like the cheater. Dice roll double sixes when he
  touches them. A voice keeps announcing "CHEATER. CHEATER."

visual: |
  - Cullan standing amid scattered board games, looking horrified
  - Dice in his hand showing DOUBLE SIXES—as if he rigged them
  - Cards in his other hand changing suits before his eyes
  - The word "CHEATER" floating in the air around him, accusatory
  - Game pieces pointing at him like fingers of blame
  - His expression shifting from confusion to horror—he's being framed

  Cullan picked up a pair of dice, and they immediately rolled double sixes. He grabbed a card, and it changed suits in his hand. From somewhere in the chaos, a voice hissed: "CHEATER. CHEATER." He wasn't cheating—but every game was rigged to make him look guilty. The room was framing him.
