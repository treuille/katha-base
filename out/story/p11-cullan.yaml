visual: |
  - Cullan standing amid scattered board games, pieces everywhere
  - His ice-blue eyes beginning to glow with an almost mystical quality
  - Faint patterns visible in the air—lines connecting rule cards to game boards
  - Game pieces arranged in formations that somehow feel wrong, rigged
  - His expression shifting from confusion to recognition
