story_beat: James tries to organize—moving sun-loving plants to sunny spots, shade
  plants to corners. It makes perfect sense. But the plants keep flickering through
  seasons regardless of position. The harder James works to arrange things, the more
  the chaos persists.

visual:
  - James mid-action, carrying a potted plant from one side of the room to another
  - Multiple plants already moved—a clear attempt at organization visible
  - Sun-loving plants clustered near the brightest windows, shade plants pulled to corners
  - But the plants are STILL flickering through seasons despite their new positions
  - A succulent James just moved to a sunny spot is now covered in frost
  - The fern in the shade corner is somehow baking in summer heat
  - James's expression frustrated but determined—this SHOULD work
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a windowsill among plant pots—frozen crimson figurine watching James's futile organizing efforts
  - Peak visual haunting—harsh shadows, cold blue dominant, warm light appearing and vanishing erratically
  - Geometry slightly warped—plant pots seem to tilt at wrong angles
  - James's neon graphic shirt catching the chaotic light, colors distorting
  - Santa hat still on, ginger hair disheveled from effort, freckles stark against their frustrated face
  - Soil on their hands and black sweatpants from moving pots

  James worked fast. Sun-lovers by the sunny windows—the succulent, the jade plant, the aloe. Shade plants to the corners—the fern, the pothos, the peace lily. It was logical. It was organized. It should have worked. But the succulent frosted over the moment James set it down. The fern burst into summer bloom in the darkest corner. "That doesn't make sense!" James said, moving plants faster now. Sunny spot, shady spot, sunny spot. Nothing changed. The room wasn't listening to where things were. It was broken in some other way James couldn't organize their way out of.
