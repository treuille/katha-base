story_beat: James works through the impossible sums. Negative cosine x! e to the x!
  The square root of seventeen times pi! The answers are college-level calculus—something
  no kid should know. But James loves math, and their brain sees the patterns immediately.
  Each answer makes a vine pull back, a fern straighten, the path clearing bit by bit.

visual:
  - James standing among the plants, pointing confidently at the floating equations
  - Equations changing as James solves them—"∫sin(x)dx = -cos(x) + C" appearing as James speaks
  - Complex calculus symbols glowing in the air—derivatives, integrals, Greek letters
  - Some vines already pulled back, the path beginning to clear
  - James's expression focused and confident—in their element
  - More equations floating nearby, waiting to be solved—"∂/∂x" and "∑" and "lim x→∞" symbols visible
  - The plants seeming impressed, leaves rustling with surprise
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a windowsill—frozen crimson figurine watching James succeed
  - EASTER EGG: A comic book left on a sunroom chair—one of James's favorite genres, suggesting they read here often
  - Light shifting from cold blue toward warmer tones as the challenge is met
  - James's neon graphic shirt catching the improving light
  - Santa hat, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles on their concentrating face
  - The sense of puzzle-solving joy on James's face

  "Negative cosine x plus C," James said, pointing at the first equation. "The integral of sine is negative cosine." The vine in front of them shuddered and pulled back. "e to the x," James continued, moving to the next. "The derivative of e to the x is just e to the x again." The fern straightened up and stepped aside. "And that one," James said, pointing at the last equation, "is about twelve point nine five—the square root of seventeen times pi divided by pi is just the square root of seventeen, which is roughly four point one two three." The plants rustled with what might have been shock. James laughed. "You picked the wrong kid for math puzzles."
