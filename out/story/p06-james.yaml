story_beat: James works through the impossible sums. Two hundred forty-seven times eighty-nine!
  The square root of two hundred eighty-nine! One-seventh as a decimal!
  But James loves math, and their brain sees the patterns immediately.
  Each answer makes a vine pull back, a fern straighten, the path clearing bit by bit.

visual:
  - James standing among the plants, pointing confidently at the floating equations
  - Equations changing as James solves them—"247 × 89 = 21,983" appearing as James speaks
  - Math problems glowing in the air—multiplication, square roots, fractions
  - Some vines already pulled back, the path beginning to clear
  - James's expression focused and confident—in their element
  - More equations floating nearby, waiting to be solved—"√289 = ?" and "1/7 = ?" visible
  - The plants seeming impressed, leaves rustling with surprise
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a windowsill—frozen crimson figurine watching James succeed
  - EASTER EGG: A comic book left on a sunroom chair—one of James's favorite genres, suggesting they read here often
  - Peak haunting atmosphere—cold harsh light cutting through greenery, pools of darkness
  - Frost still coating the glass doors and windows, ice crystals on plant pots
  - James's breath visible in the freezing air
  - James's neon graphic shirt catching the improving light
  - Santa hat, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles on their concentrating face
  - The sense of puzzle-solving joy on James's face

  "Twenty-one thousand, nine hundred eighty-three," James said, pointing at the first equation. "Two-forty-seven times eighty-nine." The vine in front of them shuddered and pulled back. "Seventeen," James continued, moving to the next. "The square root of two-eighty-nine is seventeen." The fern straightened up and stepped aside. "And that one," James said, pointing at the last equation, "is point one four two eight five seven, repeating. One-seventh." The plants rustled with what might have been shock. James laughed. "You picked the wrong kid for math puzzles."
