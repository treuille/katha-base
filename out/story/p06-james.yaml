story_beat: James works through the impossible sums. Negative four! Negative three!
  The answers are negative numbers—something most kids wouldn't think of. But James
  loves math, and their brain sees the pattern immediately. Each answer makes a vine
  pull back, a fern straighten, the path clearing bit by bit.

visual:
  - James standing among the plants, pointing confidently at the floating equations
  - Numbers changing as James solves them—"7 + (-4) = 3" appearing as James speaks
  - Some vines already pulled back, the path beginning to clear
  - James's expression focused and confident—in their element
  - More equations floating nearby, waiting to be solved
  - The plants seeming impressed, leaves rustling with surprise
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a windowsill—frozen crimson figurine watching James succeed
  - Light shifting from cold blue toward warmer tones as the challenge is met
  - James's neon graphic shirt catching the improving light
  - Santa hat, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles on their concentrating face
  - The sense of puzzle-solving joy on James's face

  "Negative four," James said, pointing at the first equation. "Seven plus negative four equals three." The vine in front of them shuddered and pulled back. "Negative three," James continued, moving to the next. "Twelve minus fifteen is negative three—so the missing number is negative three." The fern straightened up and stepped aside. The plants rustled with what might have been surprise. James laughed. "You picked the wrong kid for math puzzles."
