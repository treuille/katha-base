story_beat: Henry enters the library and discovers something impossibly wrong with the old wooden
  upright piano. Keys are flying off the keyboard at crooked angles, black and white keys unevenly
  distributed in chaotic clusters, some keys tilted sideways or sticking straight up. He sits down
  and tries to play, but it sounds horrible.

visual:
  - Henry standing before the old wooden upright piano, staring in disbelief
  - A blue binder of sheet music open on the music stand, messy stacks of books piled on top of the piano
  - An upright cello on a stand next to the piano
  - The piano keyboard is impossibly wrong—keys flying off at crooked angles, some tilted sideways, others sticking straight up
  - Black and white keys unevenly distributed in chaotic clusters—five black keys bunched together here, a long stretch of only white keys there
  - Some keys hovering slightly above the keyboard, others sunken deep into the wood
  - Gaps where keys should be, doubled-up keys jammed together at odd angles
  - Henry's hands hovering over the chaos, unsure where to even begin
  - The blue binder of sheet music on the stand, completely useless for this madness
  - The library still cold and blue, harsh shadows pooling strangely
  - Books on shelves behind him, Graminy's aviation shelf visible
  - Cold blue light streaming through windows
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on the corner of a bookshelf - frozen crimson figurine watching
  - Henry's expression shifting from confusion to determination, Santa hat slightly askew
  - His massive flight manual set aside on a reading table
  - 'EASTER EGG: A well-worn cookbook titled "The Pilot''s Kitchen: High-Altitude Baking" visible on the reading table next to his flight manual'

  The library's old wooden upright piano had gone completely mad. Henry stared at the keyboard—keys were flying off at crooked angles, some tilted sideways, others sticking straight up like broken teeth. Black and white keys had redistributed themselves in impossible clusters—five black keys bunched together here, a long lonely stretch of white keys there. Some keys hovered above the keyboard, trembling. He sat down and tried a scale. The sound that came out was awful. The piano had forgotten how to be a piano.
