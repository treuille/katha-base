story_beat: Henry enters the library and discovers something wrong with the old wooden
  upright piano. The black and white keys have rearranged themselves—seemingly at
  random, with no pattern. He sits down and tries to play, but it sounds horrible.

visual:
  - Henry standing before the old wooden upright piano, staring in confusion
  - The piano keyboard is completely wrong—black keys where white keys should be, white keys scattered randomly, no logical pattern at all
  - Some keys are doubled, some gaps are too wide, the entire keyboard looks like it's been shuffled
  - Henry's hands hovering over the keys, hesitant
  - Sheet music on the stand, but it won't help with keys in wrong places
  - The library still cold and blue, harsh shadows pooling strangely
  - Books on shelves behind him, Graminy's aviation shelf visible
  - Cold blue light streaming through windows
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on the corner of a bookshelf - frozen crimson figurine watching
  - Henry's expression shifting from confusion to determination, Santa hat slightly askew
  - His massive flight manual set aside on a reading table
  - 'EASTER EGG: A well-worn cookbook titled "The Pilot''s Kitchen: High-Altitude Baking" visible on the reading table next to his flight manual'

  The library's old upright piano was wrong. Henry stared at the keyboard—the black and white keys had scrambled themselves into complete chaos. Two white keys here, four black keys there, gaps in impossible places. He sat down and tried a scale. The sound that came out was awful. Every note was in the wrong place. The piano had forgotten how to be a piano.
