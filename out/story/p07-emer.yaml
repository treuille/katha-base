  Through sheer determination and memory of Mommy's recipe, Emer manages to make
  one cup of hot cocoa that tastes right. But the kitchen chaos continues around
  her—she's calmed one small part but the deeper scrambling remains. She realizes
  her heart isn't quite the right tool for this room.

visual:
  - Emer sitting on the chair, hands wrapped around a unicorn-themed mug of steaming hot cocoa
  - A small proud smile on her face—she did it, one cup is right
  - But around her, the kitchen remains chaotic—jars still mislabeled, recipe cards still shuffling
  - The contrast between her small victory (the perfect cup) and the larger unsolved problem
  - She looks troubled, realizing this room needs something she doesn't have
  - Visibly warmer atmosphere than before—golden light returning around Emer, the harsh cold receding
  - Medium haunting lingers at the edges—hints of blue at the corners, geometry still slightly off
  - A thin line of frost remains on the far window, but melting near where Emer sits
  - Warm brown cocoa steam rises prominently, bringing color back to the scene
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette behind a mixing bowl—frozen crimson figurine watching her partial success

  Emer closed her eyes and remembered. Mommy's hands guiding hers. The exact order. She made one perfect cup of cocoa—she could taste it was right. But the kitchen still churned around her. Love and memory helped—but something else was needed here. Something more... organized.
