  Emer drags a heavy chair across the kitchen floor and climbs up to reach the
  counter. She tries to organize ingredients and make hot cocoa from memory,
  but the chaos keeps fighting back—labels swap, ingredients slide away.

visual:
  - Emer standing on a wooden chair she dragged to the counter, reaching up with determination
  - Her small hands grasp a mixing bowl, ingredients gathered around her
  - She's remembering Mommy's steps—cocoa powder, sugar, milk—but jars keep swapping contents
  - Scuff marks on the floor from where she dragged the heavy chair
  - Her santa hat tilted from the effort of climbing
  - Expression of fierce concentration mixed with frustration
  - Her My Little Pony doll propped against a canister nearby, as if cheering her on
  - Peak haunting atmosphere—cold harsh light, pools of darkness in corners, proportions warped
  - Frost creeping across the window panes, ice crystals forming on the edges of countertops
  - Emer's breath visible in the freezing air, frost rimming the edges of jars
  - Kitchen angles feel wrong—walls seem to lean, counters loom too high
  - Harsh shadows cutting across the scene, geometry deeply unsettling

  Emer dragged the heavy chair across the floor—scraaape—just like Mommy taught her. She climbed up carefully, reaching for the cocoa. "First the powder, then the sugar..." But the jars kept swapping! Every time she looked away, they traded places again.
