story_beat: Henry enters the kitchen that Emer partially calmed. Her single perfect
  cup of cocoa sits on the counter—one warm thing amid chaos. But the kitchen doesn't
  just scramble anymore. It ACCUSES. Recipe cards rewrite themselves with hostile
  messages. Jars rattle and point at him. The oven display flashes "INTRUDER." He's
  being framed as someone who doesn't belong.

visual:
  - Henry standing in the kitchen doorway, facing the accusations
  - Emer's single cup of cocoa glowing warm on the counter—her small victory amid the chaos
  - 'Recipe cards hovering and displaying hostile text: "YOU''LL RUIN EVERYTHING" and "YOU DON''T BELONG"'
  - Jars rattling on shelves, seeming to lean and point accusingly toward Henry
  - The oven display glowing with the word "INTRUDER" in harsh red letters
  - Ingredients scattered chaotically—flour spilled, sugar overturned, eggs rolling
  - Cold blue light dominant, harsh accusatory shadows pointing at Henry
  - His expression: hurt for a moment, then resolute—he knows who he really is
  - Santa hat and grey tracksuit standing out against the cold hostile kitchen
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a high shelf behind jars - frozen crimson figurine orchestrating the accusations

  The kitchen had something to say. Recipe cards floated up and rewrote themselves: "YOU'LL RUIN EVERYTHING." Jars rattled on the shelves, leaning toward him like pointing fingers. The oven display flashed red: "INTRUDER. INTRUDER. INTRUDER." But Henry saw Emer's cup of cocoa on the counter—one perfect warm thing in all the cold chaos. She'd made that with love. The kitchen was calling him a destroyer. Someone who didn't care. But that wasn't true. That wasn't true at all.
