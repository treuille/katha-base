story_beat: Working together, the children grab the blazing deity and wrestle it
  into a box. The spirit is furious, shining light through every crack, but
  contained. Simple collective action, funny and chaotic.

  "Grab him!" Everyone moved at once. Six pairs of hands seized the blazing, wiggling spirit and wrestled it toward a big wooden box. The deity complained loudly, but they got the lid closed.
