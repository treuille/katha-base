story_beat: The ornament flares and the spirit erupts, growing huge and blazing
  red. Emer realizes it's furious because it's cramped—too big for a house,
  it needs sky!

visual: |
  - The ornament exploding with blazing red light
  - A huge, fierce spirit form erupting from it, filling the room - the room goes COLD, not hot
  - The spirit has deep crimson red skin, slightly drunken or intoxicated-looking eyes
  - RAINBOW LIGHT and ICE emanating from the spirit instead of fire - no flames
  - Frosty mist and rainbow prismatic light swirling around the deity
  - All six children recoiling but standing their ground
  - The spirit clearly too big for the space, cramped and angry

  The ornament FLARED. Red light blazed as a huge spirit burst free—all rainbows and icy fury, weapons spinning, face twisted in rage. The room went cold, not hot. But Emer understood first: "He's not evil—he's cramped! He's too big for inside. He needs sky!"
