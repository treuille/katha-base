story_beat: The moment the spirit is pulled into open space, it transforms—his flames soften into wind, his weapons turn into sparkles, his screaming face relaxes. He remembers he's not a monster but a sky guardian who forgot himself. The spirit sees himself reflected in the sky (the sky becomes his mirror). The house glows with a gentle protective aura instead of scrambled chaos.
