story_beat: Cullan enters the dining room and discovers a horrifying truth—his placecard
  is missing. Everyone else's sits neatly on their plates. But where Cullan should sit,
  there's nothing. The room is erasing him from Christmas dinner.

visual: |
  - Cullan stepping into the dining room, face going pale with shock
  - The long formal table with neat placecards on each plate—names visible
  - One plate with NO placecard—the empty space where Cullan's name should be
  - Candles flickering ominously, one going out as he watches
  - His ice-blue eyes fixed on the empty spot, realizing what it means
  - The room rejecting him, making him invisible, erasing his place

  The dining room took Cullan's breath away—but not in a good way. Every plate had a placecard with someone's name in careful handwriting. Mom. Dad. Graminy. Arthur. Everyone. But where Cullan always sat, there was nothing. Just an empty plate. His name was gone. Like he'd never been part of Christmas at all.
