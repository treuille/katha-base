visual: |
  - Cullan stepping into the dining room, eyes wide with surprise
  - The long formal table in disarray—chairs at odd angles, place settings scrambled
  - Candles flickering wildly, some blowing out even as others flare
  - His ice-blue eyes scanning the chaos, trying to make sense of it
  - The room feeling unsettled, as if a wind is moving through despite closed windows

  The dining room was a mess. Chairs had slid to wrong places. Plates sat before empty seats while people's spots had nothing. And the candles—they kept blowing out in crazy patterns, like invisible fingers were snuffing them one by one. "What is going on?" Cullan whispered.
