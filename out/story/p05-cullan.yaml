# This should be a few bullet points, each just a few words or a relatively simple sentences long. It will be used as input into the prompt engine.
# DO NOT: Copy / replicate / duplicate any visual information from

#   3. location/location_id.yaml
# as this information will be separately added into the visual prompt.
# It should frame a single dramatic image and a single moment in time which makes sense with the story text.

  - Plates and silverware drift across the table surface
  - Name cards shuffle and swap places on their own
