  Cullan pushed open the dining room door and gasped. Every candle in the room had somehow clustered into one corner—dozens of flames burning dangerously high, licking toward the velvet curtains. One spark and the whole house could catch fire! But despite all those flames, the room felt freezing. Frost crept across the windows. Something was very, very wrong.
