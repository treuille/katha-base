visual: |
  - Ultra-flat Marin Hanford style with graphic shapes and bold flat colors
  - Elegant dining room with a long table set with candelabras everywhere
  - Cullan stands in the doorway, eyes wide with surprise
  - Multiple candles going out simultaneously—little puffs of smoke rising in a pattern
  - Pff-pff-pff visual effect: candles extinguishing in a zigzag across the table
  - Chairs visibly askew, place settings mismatched, but focus is on the dying candles
  - Golden warm tones of the room dimming as more flames disappear

  The dining room was set for a fancy dinner, candles everywhere. But as Cullan watched, they started going out. Pff. Pff. Pff-pff-pff. No wind, no reason. He turned to look at one, and three behind him went dark.
