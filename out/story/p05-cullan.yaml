story_beat: Cullan enters the dining room and sees something dangerous—all the candles
  have clustered together in one corner, flames burning too high, too close to the
  curtains. A fire hazard that could burn down the whole house. The room feels
  cold despite the flames.

  Cullan pushed open the dining room door and gasped. Every candle in the room had somehow clustered into one corner—dozens of flames burning dangerously high, licking toward the velvet curtains. One spark and the whole house could catch fire! But despite all those flames, the room felt freezing. Frost crept across the windows. Something was very, very wrong.
