  Cullan pushed open the dining room door and gasped. Every candle in the room had somehow clustered into one corner—dozens of flames burning dangerously high. And the brocade curtains had already caught fire! Flames climbed up the fabric, spreading fast. The house was burning! Waves of scorching heat and icy cold currents swirled around Cullan, frost creeping across the windows even as flames licked higher. His face went pale, his eyes wide with disbelief.
