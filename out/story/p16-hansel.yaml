story_beat: The plants respond to Hansel's laughter. They relax and let the sunlight
  stream back in. Hansel sits happily, sucking his bottle. Being happy helps in every
  situation—and stockings make great sleds.

visual:
  - The sun room transformed—plants settling back to normal size all around
  - Sunlight streaming in through the windows as foliage parts
  - Hansel sitting happily, sucking his bottle contentedly
  - Warm golden light flooding the room, the jungle tamed
  - A wooden table nearby with the board game "Ravine" visible
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on windowsill—frozen crimson figurine diminished in the restored warmth
  - Plants seeming content, leaves turned toward Hansel in gratitude
  - Pure contentment and peace

  All around him, the plants relaxed. They grew smaller, settled back where they belonged. Sunlight poured in as the leaves pulled away from the windows. Hansel sat there happily, sucking his bottle. Being happy helped with everything—scary stairs, wild plants, all of it. And stockings made great sleds.
