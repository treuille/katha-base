story_beat: Hansel starts to laugh. Not scared laughter—real, delighted laughter at
  the absurdity and wonder of it all. His giggles echo through the jungle room.
  The plants hear him and begin to respond, their tension easing.

visual:
  - Hansel on his back, laughing up at the jungle canopy
  - His laughter genuine and bright, bubbling up from pure joy
  - The nearest plants beginning to relax—leaves uncurling, vines loosening, becoming happy
  - Sunlight starting to return as foliage parts from the windows
  - A wooden table nearby with the board game "Ravine" visible on it
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette visible—frozen crimson figurine diminished as joy spreads
  - The atmosphere shifting from threatening to magical
  - Hansel's nautical-print sleeper visible, his whole body shaking with giggles

  Hansel started to laugh. Not scared—just happy. It bubbled up from his tummy, real giggles that echoed through the jungle. The big fern above him seemed to pause. Its leaves uncurled just a little. The vine nearby loosened its grip on the window.
