story_beat: Hansel's rhythm spreads. He points his bottle like a conductor—at each
  plant, each window. TAP-tap-tap. His laughter rings out, genuine and bright. The
  seasons align. Plants settle. Every window shows the same soft winter afternoon.

visual:
  - Hansel pointing his bottle like a conductor's baton, directing the rhythm
  - Plants responding all around him—fern settling into spring, succulent in summer
  - All windows now showing the SAME soft winter afternoon light—synchronized
  - Hansel laughing with pure joy, the room transformed around him
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on windowsill—frozen crimson figurine diminished in the warm golden light
  - Rich warm colors dominant—golden light, healthy green plants, peaceful atmosphere
  - Hansel's nautical-print sleeper bright in the restored warmth, Santa hat proud on his head

  Hansel pointed his bottle at the fern—TAP. At the succulent—tap-tap. At each window in turn. His laughter bubbled up, real and bright. The seasons stopped fighting. Through every window, the same soft winter light. The sun room remembered what peace felt like.
