story_beat: Hansel starts to laugh. Not scared laughter—real, delighted laughter at
  the absurdity and wonder of it all. His giggles echo through the jungle room.
  The plants hear him and begin to respond, their tension easing.

visual:
  - Hansel on his back, making brave sounds up at the jungle canopy—not quite laughter, more like determined baby courage
  - His expression showing resolve and intensity even as a baby—he's doing something important
  - The nearest plants beginning to respond—leaves uncurling slightly, vines loosening
  - Sunlight starting to return as foliage parts from the windows
  - A wooden table nearby with the board game "Ravine" visible on it
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette visible—frozen crimson figurine diminished but still watching
  - The atmosphere beginning to shift, but darkness still present at the edges
  - Hansel's nautical-print sleeper visible, his small body showing worried but determined energy

  Hansel started to laugh. Not scared—just happy. It bubbled up from his tummy, real giggles that echoed through the jungle. The big fern above him seemed to pause. Its leaves uncurled just a little. The vine nearby loosened its grip on the window.
