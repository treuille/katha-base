story_beat: Arthur enters and sees the clustered candles—fire hazard, just like
  Cullan described. But Arthur sees something else: the PATTERN of how they cluster.
  It's like a Rubik's cube mid-solve. There's an order underneath the chaos, and
  he can see it.

visual: |
  - Arthur stepping into the dining room, eyes widening with recognition
  - All Christmas candles CLUSTERED dangerously in one corner
  - Flames burning too high, too close to velvet curtains
  - But Arthur's expression is analytical, not panicked
  - Faint overlay effect: ghostly lines showing where candles SHOULD be
  - Like seeing a Rubik's cube solution overlaid on scrambled colors
  - Cold blue light from windows despite the dangerous flames
  - His quiet confidence returning—he sees the pattern others miss

  The candles were exactly as Cullan described—clustered in one corner, flames licking toward the curtains. But Arthur didn't see chaos. He saw a Rubik's cube, three moves from solved. The candles weren't random—they'd been pushed out of balance, and balance had a pattern. He could see where each one belonged, like ghost-images hovering in the air. This wasn't about speed. This was about seeing.
