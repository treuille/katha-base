  Emer bumps into Henry in the hallway. Henry is coming from the library, still
  glowing with excitement from his piano success. The hallway still feels wrong,
  but Henry is energized. Emer describes the chaos in the kitchen.

visual:
  - Emer and Henry meeting in the hallway
  - Henry looking energized and happy, still buzzing from his piano success
  - Emer looking up at tall Henry, her My Little Pony doll tucked under one arm, gesturing animatedly about what she saw
  - She mimes stirring and the jars swapping with her hands
  - Henry in his grey Aviator Nation tracksuit, leaning down to listen intently
  - The height difference between 5-year-old Emer and 15-year-old Henry emphasized
  - Hallway still somewhat cold and blue, but warmer near Henry
  - Tiny Dorje Legpa statuette on a hallway shelf behind them

  "Henry!" Emer ran to her big cousin in the hallway. Henry was practically bouncing—he couldn't stop smiling. "The kitchen is all wrong!" Emer said. "The jars keep trading places and everything's mixing itself into horrible goop and I made ONE cup of cocoa but—" She waved her arms. Henry knelt down to listen.
