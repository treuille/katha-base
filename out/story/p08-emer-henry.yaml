  Emer bumps into Henry in the hallway. Henry is coming from the library, still
  glowing with excitement from his piano success. The hallway still feels wrong,
  but Henry is energized. Emer describes the chaos in the kitchen.

visual:
  - Emer and Henry just ran into each other in the hallway
  - Both look exhausted and drained from their first room challenges—relief mixed with weariness
  - Henry relieved from his piano success but visibly tired, catching his breath, shoulders slumped slightly
  - Emer looking up at tall Henry, her My Little Pony doll tucked under one arm, gesturing about what she saw
  - She mimes stirring and the jars swapping with her hands
  - Henry in his grey Aviator Nation tracksuit, leaning down to listen intently
  - The height difference between 5-year-old Emer and 15-year-old Henry emphasized
  - Medium haunting atmosphere—cold blue tones emerging, harsh shadows, geometry slightly off
  - Frost creeping across window frames and along the baseboards
  - Cold blue tinge to the light, shadows pooling in corners
  - Picture frames hanging crooked, some tilted
  - The geometry of the hallway feels slightly wrong—walls seem to lean
  - Tiny Dorje Legpa statuette on a hallway shelf behind them

  "Henry!" Emer ran to her big cousin in the hallway. Henry was practically bouncing—he couldn't stop smiling. "The kitchen is all wrong!" Emer said. "The jars keep trading places and everything's mixing itself into horrible goop and I made ONE cup of cocoa but—" She waved her arms. Henry knelt down to listen. He thought about his own strange experience in the library.
