  Emer bumps into Henry in the hallway. The hallway is at peak wrongness—cold,
  tilted, shadows pooling strangely. Emer describes the chaos in the kitchen,
  how the recipes kept rewriting themselves.

visual:
  - Emer and Henry meeting in the cold, tilted hallway
  - Emer looking up at tall Henry, gesturing animatedly about what she saw
  - She mimes stirring and the jars swapping with her hands
  - Henry in his grey Aviator Nation tracksuit, leaning down to listen intently
  - The height difference between 5-year-old Emer and 15-year-old Henry emphasized
  - Cold blue light, harsh shadows, geometry slightly warped around them
  - Tiny Dorje Legpa statuette on a hallway shelf behind them

  "Henry!" Emer ran to her big cousin in the hallway. "The kitchen is all wrong! The jars keep trading and the recipes won't stay still and I made ONE cup of cocoa but—" She waved her arms, showing him the chaos. Henry knelt down to listen.
