story_beat: Both realize simultaneously—"This house is haunted." A visual beat
  showing their dawning realization and rising concern.

visual:
  - Emer and Henry facing each other, determination on their faces
  - Emer gesturing emphatically, eyes locked on Henry, excited now rather than just scared
  - Henry nodding confidently, hands at his sides—he already fixed one room
  - The hallway still wrong around them, but they're not intimidated
  - Urgent communication through eye contact and body language
  - Their breath visible in the cold air, but they're standing tall and resolute
