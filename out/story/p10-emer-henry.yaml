  They compare notes, realizing the connections between their experiences.
  Everything is scrambled—recipes, stories, rules. A dawning understanding
  begins—something is very wrong with this house.

visual:
  - Emer and Henry leaning toward each other, comparing experiences
  - Both have expressions of dawning realization
  - Ghost overlays merging—kitchen jars and library books, both scrambled the same way
  - Emer bouncing slightly with nervous energy, Henry stroking his chin thoughtfully
  - The visual wrongness at its peak around them—tilted frames, pooling shadows
  - Cold blue dominant with harsh lighting
