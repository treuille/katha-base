story_beat: Hansel plays near the tree when he notices something wrong. A musical
  ornament plays a lullaby, but the tune is off-key, wrong. His rattle makes no sound
  when he shakes it. The world has gone strange in ways only a baby would notice.

visual:
  - Hansel sitting near the Christmas tree, his expression shifting from content to confused
  - A musical ornament on the tree—visibly playing but the notes seem wrong
  - Hansel shaking his rattle, but it makes no sound—his face puzzled
  - His baby bottle nearby, ready to become his pointing tool
  - EASTER EGG: The watching ornament IS Dorje Legpa—tiny crimson deity figurine pulsing with light that doesn't match the other ornaments
  - EASTER EGG: A small crossed German and French flag ornament tucked away on the tree
  - Warm golden light beginning to drain at edges, hints of cold blue creeping in
  - No other characters in frame except Hansel and the Dorje Legpa ornament

  A musical ornament on the tree played a lullaby, but the tune was wrong—off-key, sour. Hansel shook his rattle. Nothing. No sound at all. He shook it again. Silence. Something was very wrong with the world, and Hansel knew it.
