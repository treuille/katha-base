story_beat: Hansel plays near the tree, clapping happily. But then he notices the
  Christmas lights blinking off-rhythm—wrong, wrong, wrong. His clapping falters.
  The ornament seems to pulse at him specifically, disrupting his joy.

visual:
  - Hansel mid-clap, his hands frozen apart as he stares at the Christmas tree
  - His expression shifting from joy to confusion—something is wrong with the lights
  - Christmas lights on tree blinking in visible disarray, some too fast, some too slow
  - His baby bottle nearby, ready to become his pointing tool
  - EASTER EGG: The watching ornament IS Dorje Legpa—tiny crimson deity figurine pulsing with light that doesn't match the other ornaments
  - EASTER EGG: A small crossed German and French flag ornament tucked away on the tree
  - Warm golden light beginning to drain at edges, hints of cold blue creeping in
  - No other characters in frame except Hansel and the Dorje Legpa ornament

  Hansel loved clapping. Clap-clap-clap, all morning long. But then he saw the tree lights. They blinked wrong. Fast-slow-fast-nothing-fast. His hands stopped mid-clap. One ornament pulsed differently from all the others—watching him, daring him to fix what it had broken.
