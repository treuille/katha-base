story_beat: Instead of fighting the rigged stairs, James stops. They remember Hansel's
  rhythm, their own morning rituals, the viola. They start creating something new—tapping
  the banister like fingering notes, humming a pattern. A ritual for climbing. The
  stairs begin to listen.

visual:
  - James standing still on the stairs, one hand on the banister, eyes closed in concentration
  - Their other hand tapping the banister rhythmically—like viola fingering
  - Their mouth slightly open, humming or speaking words
  - A visible shift beginning—warm golden tones starting to seep back in at the edges
  - The harsh geometry beginning to soften, steps starting to look more normal
  - The stocking nearest to James flickering—the wrong name starting to fade
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a shelf along the staircase—frozen crimson figurine seeming to lean back as James's authority fills the space
  - The cold retreating, warmth returning—visual transition from blue to gold beginning
  - James's expression peaceful, focused—ninja training showing in their stillness
  - The rhythm visible in the scene—perhaps dust motes moving in pattern, or light pulsing gently
  - Neon graphic shirt starting to look vibrant again as warm light returns
  - Santa hat, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles—identity being reclaimed through ritual

  James stopped climbing. They stopped fighting. They thought about Hansel pointing with his bottle—not random, but rhythmic. They thought about their own mornings—Spelling Bee, Wordle, puzzles, always in the same order. They thought about viola lessons, how the fingering was like a path your hand already knew. James started tapping the banister. One-two-three. One-two-three. They hummed a note. Then another. "Up means up," James said, and their voice sounded different. Steady. Sure. Like the beginning of something. "Down means down." The stairs seemed to pause. To listen.
