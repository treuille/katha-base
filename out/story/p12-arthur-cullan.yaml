  - Both boys with sudden understanding dawning on their faces
  - Arthur and Cullan are the same height, fist-bumping at eye level
  - Arthur's Rubik's cube visible in his pocket, Cullan's smartwatch on wrist
  - A spark of hope in their expressions despite the haunted hallway
  - Fist bump frozen in the middle of the frame
  - The cold blue hallway still wrong, but the boys standing strong together
  - A moment of determination and friendship
  - Their best-friend bond visible in how they face the challenge
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette peeking from behind a doorframe in the background - frozen crimson figurine almost hidden but watching

  "Wait," Arthur said. "Your room has candles that won't stay distributed fairly. And my room has a Scrabble game with rigged rules." He paused. "That's your thing—you hate unfair rules."
  Cullan's eyes lit up. "And you're amazing at seeing patterns. Swap?"
  They bumped fists. "Swap."
