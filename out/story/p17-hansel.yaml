story_beat: The plants respond to Hansel's laughter. They relax, settle back to normal
  size, and let the sunlight stream back in. The jungle becomes a peaceful sun room
  again, warm and bright. But Hansel senses something deeper still wrong in the house.

visual:
  - The sun room transformed—plants settling back to normal size all around
  - Sunlight streaming in through the windows as foliage parts
  - Hansel sitting up now, surrounded by happy, peaceful plants
  - Warm golden light flooding the room, the jungle tamed
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on windowsill—frozen crimson figurine diminished in the restored warmth
  - Plants seeming content, leaves turned toward Hansel in gratitude
  - But Hansel's expression shows he senses something else—the source is still out there

  All around him, the plants relaxed. They grew smaller, settled back where they belonged. Sunlight poured in as the leaves pulled away from the windows. The jungle became a peaceful sun room again. Hansel sat up, smiling. But he felt something else—a deeper wrongness, somewhere in the house. His cousins needed him.
