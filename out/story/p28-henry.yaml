story_beat: That evening, Henry sits by the tree—the real tree now, no strange
  ornaments. He reflects on what he discovered about himself. By declaring who he
  truly is—someone who bakes with love for his friends—he helped restore the house.

visual:
  - Henry sitting by the Christmas tree, a half-eaten cupcake in his hand
  - The tree looking normal and peaceful—no strange ornaments, just simple decorations
  - His goofy grin back in full force, flour still dusted on his santa hat
  - A warm, satisfied expression—he made something real for people he loves
  - The living room returned to its natural warmth—cozy and true
  - Warm golden light, the tray of airplane-topped cupcakes visible nearby
  - Through the window, soft winter evening settling over the snowy woods
  - His grey Aviator Nation tracksuit with rainbow stripes, white slip-on shoes
  - The sense of love given and received, care proven stronger than chaos

  That evening, Henry sat by the tree—the real tree now, no strange ornaments. His cupcake tray sat nearby, mostly empty now—everyone had loved the little airplanes in the icing. He licked frosting off his fingers and smiled. The kitchen had called him an intruder. Said he didn't belong. But that was ridiculous. He belonged in kitchens. He belonged wherever there were people to feed and recipes to follow and love to measure out in cups and tablespoons. That was his superpower, really. Not just baking. Caring. Caring so much that he could fill a whole house with warmth, one cupcake at a time.
