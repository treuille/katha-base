story_beat: That evening, Henry sits by the tree with his cousins. His cupcake tray
  is almost empty—everyone loved them. Music and proper measuring saved the day.

visual:
  - Henry sitting by the Christmas tree, a half-eaten cupcake in his hand, happy and content
  - A steaming mug of hot cocoa beside him
  - The tree looking normal and peaceful—no strange ornaments, just simple decorations
  - His goofy grin back in full force, flour still dusted on his santa hat
  - A warm, satisfied expression—he made something real for people he loves
  - The living room returned to its natural warmth—cozy and true
  - Warm golden light, the tray of airplane-topped cupcakes visible nearby, mostly empty
  - Through the window, soft winter evening settling over the snowy woods
  - His grey Aviator Nation tracksuit with rainbow stripes, white slip-on shoes
  - EASTER EGG: A "Hamilton" cast recording CD case peeking out from under some wrapping paper near Henry—a gift he hasn't opened yet

  That evening, Henry sat by the tree. His cupcake tray was almost empty—everyone had loved the little airplanes in the icing. He licked frosting off his fingers and smiled. Creativity for the piano. Precision for the kitchen. Both had worked perfectly.
