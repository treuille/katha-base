  - Dynamic action shot: Cullan as a blur racing around the dining table
  - A comically long match in his hand, trailing flame like a comet
  - Multiple candles relighting in his wake, flames leaning toward him
  - His santa hat flying back from the speed
  - His expression determined, athletic form in full sprint mode
