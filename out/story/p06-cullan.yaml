story_beat: The haunting escalates and the main character tries a simple, obvious
  solution based on what seems to make sense at first.

visual: |
  - Ultra-flat illustration style—bold graphic shapes, no depth shading, clean edges
  - Candles blowing out in a wild spiral pattern across the entire room
  - Cullan reaching for a COMICALLY OVERSIZED fireplace match on the mantel—nearly as long as his arm
  - His expression shifts from frustration to determination
  - His stance is athletic, crouched like a track sprinter about to launch
  - The room is half-lit, half-dark, candles going out in waves
  - Flat color blocks emphasize the chaos: gold flames, dark smoke puffs, Cullan's blue outfit
