  the dangerous corner. The harder he works, the faster they return.

  - Dynamic action shot: Cullan as a blur racing around the dining table
  - Blowing out candles with his speed, moving them to safe positions around the room
  - But candles visibly SLIDING BACK across the table surface toward the corner
  - The geometry of the room warping further—shadows deepening, angles wrong
  - His santa hat flying back from the speed, expression frustrated
  - Cold blue tones dominating, harsh shadows pooling
  - Trails of smoke from extinguished candles
  - The curtains still dangerously close to where candles keep clustering

  Cullan became a blur. He raced around the table, blowing out candles, moving them to safe spots all around the room. But the moment he set one down, it started sliding back—scraping across the tablecloth toward the corner like something was pulling it. The harder he worked, the faster they clustered back together. It was like trying to bail out a sinking boat with a thimble.
