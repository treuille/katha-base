  Cullan became a blur. He raced around the table, blowing out candles, beating at the burning curtains with anything he could grab. But the moment he put out one spot, another flared up. The candles kept sliding back together like something was pulling them. The harder he fought, the faster the flames spread. It was like trying to bail out a sinking boat with a thimble.
