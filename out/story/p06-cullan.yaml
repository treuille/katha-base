story_beat: As more candles blow out, more traces of Cullan vanish. His chair slides
  away. Desperate, he uses his speed to keep candles lit—racing around the table in
  a blur. The candles hold, but the deeper horror continues.

  - Dynamic action shot: Cullan as a blur racing around the dining table
  - A comically long match in his hand, trailing flame like a comet
  - Multiple candles relighting in his wake, flames leaning toward him
  - But his CHAIR sliding away from the table even as he runs
  - His placecard reappearing—but BLANK, his name erased
  - His santa hat flying back from the speed, expression desperate

  Another candle blew out, and Cullan's chair slid away from the table on its own. "No!" He grabbed the longest match he could find and became a blur—racing, relighting, keeping the flames alive through sheer speed. Every candle blazed. But when he stopped to catch his breath, his placecard had reappeared... completely blank. His name was still gone.
