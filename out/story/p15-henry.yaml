story_beat: Henry takes control. He pushes the chaotic bowl aside and pulls out proper
  measuring cups, a clean bowl, and a recipe. He starts measuring ingredients precisely,
  the way a real baker—or pilot—would. The chaos pauses, surprised.

visual:
  - Henry standing tall in the kitchen, taking charge with urgent intensity
  - His hands pulling out measuring cups and spoons with purposeful speed, a proper mixing bowl
  - A recipe card propped up where he can see it
  - The chaotic bowl pushed aside, its disgusting contents ignored
  - Henry measuring flour with intense precision, leveling it perfectly—no room for error
  - The chaos PAUSING mid-motion—ingredients frozen mid-air, watching him
  - Warm golden tones beginning to seep back in from the edges of the frame
  - Cold blue retreating toward the corners but still threatening
  - His expression: intense focus and worried resolve, like a pilot handling an emergency checklist
  - The fridge to the right of the dishwasher, gleaming as order returns
  - Grey tracksuit and Santa hat, his posture commanding but tense
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a shelf seeming to lean back - frozen crimson figurine retreating as Henry's precision fills the room

  Henry pushed the disgusting bowl aside. "That's not how you bake." He opened drawers and pulled out measuring cups—one cup, half cup, quarter cup. Measuring spoons. A clean mixing bowl. A recipe card. The flying ingredients froze mid-air, watching him. He scooped flour, leveled it perfectly, and poured it into the bowl. One cup exactly. The chaos held its breath. This was how a real baker worked.
