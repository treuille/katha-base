story_beat: Henry doesn't argue with the accusations. He simply declares who he is.
  "I bake for my friends. Every measurement is an act of love. I follow checklists
  because I care." He starts pulling out ingredients—flour, sugar, eggs, cocoa. Cupcake
  tins. The room hesitates. The chaos pauses. Warmth begins creeping back at the edges.

visual:
  - Henry standing tall in the kitchen, speaking with quiet authority
  - His hands already reaching for ingredients—flour, sugar, cocoa powder, eggs
  - A mixing bowl on the counter, cupcake tins visible nearby
  - The chaos PAUSING mid-motion—jars frozen mid-rattle, recipe cards suspended mid-flip
  - The hostile text on recipe cards beginning to fade
  - Warm golden tones beginning to seep back in from the edges of the frame
  - Cold blue retreating toward the corners
  - His expression: calm certainty, the goofy smile replaced by quiet confidence
  - Steam beginning to rise from where warmth returns
  - Grey tracksuit and Santa hat, but his posture commanding and sure
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a shelf seeming to lean back - frozen crimson figurine retreating as Henry's authority fills the room

  "I bake for my friends." Henry's voice was quiet, but it filled the kitchen. "Every measurement is an act of love. Every checklist is an act of care." He reached for the flour. The sugar. The cocoa. The eggs. The jars stopped rattling. The recipe cards hung frozen in mid-flip, their angry words fading. The oven display flickered and went dark. The room was listening. Henry pulled out the cupcake tins.
