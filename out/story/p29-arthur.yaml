  ornaments. He reflects on what he discovered about himself. By focusing on his
  gift for seeing patterns, he helped restore the house to its natural, peaceful state.

visual:
  - Arthur sitting happily by the Christmas tree in warm evening light, radiating safety and contentment
  - A steaming mug of HOT CHOCOLATE on the floor beside him
  - The tree looking normal and peaceful—no strange ornaments, just simple decorations
  - Instead of Rubik's cube: working on a TANGRAM PUZZLE or JIGSAW—showing his pattern skills in a new way
  - His expression: genuinely happy, safe, at peace
  - The living room returned to its natural, unadorned warmth—cozy and real
  - Warm golden light from lamps and tree lights, everything in its proper place
  - Through the window, soft winter evening settling over the snowy woods
  - His santa hat slightly askew, messy curly brown hair, quiet confident smile
  - EASTER EGGS related to his interests scattered around him: a Scrabble tile bag, a book of mathematical patterns, his dodecahedron Rubik's cube solved and resting nearby, a crossword puzzle book
  - The sense of a puzzle completed, harmony restored

  That evening, Arthur sat by the tree—the real tree now, no strange ornaments. Just lights and tinsel and the old familiar decorations. His hot chocolate steamed beside him as he fitted the last tangram piece into place, completing a perfect swan. His solved dodecahedron rested nearby. The dining room candles were still where he'd placed them, burning steady. He hadn't just seen the pattern. He'd restored it. That was the thing about patterns—they wanted to be whole. And maybe that was his gift. Not just noticing when things were scrambled, but knowing exactly where each piece belonged to make them right again.
