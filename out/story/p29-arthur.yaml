  - NOTE: Ensure any visible text/words are legible, not garbled
  - NOTE: Focus on describing the ROOM rather than Arthur
  - The living room returned to its natural, unadorned warmth—cozy and real
  - Christmas tree looking normal and peaceful—no strange ornaments, just simple decorations
  - Warm golden light from lamps and tree lights, everything in its proper place
  - Through the window, soft winter evening settling over the snowy woods
  - A steaming mug of HOT CHOCOLATE on the floor
  - Arthur sitting by the tree, working on a TANGRAM PUZZLE or JIGSAW
  - EASTER EGGS related to his interests scattered around: a Scrabble tile bag, a book of mathematical patterns, his dodecahedron Rubik's cube solved and resting nearby, a crossword puzzle book
  - The sense of a puzzle completed, harmony restored

  That evening, Arthur sat by the tree—the real tree now, no strange ornaments. Just lights and tinsel and the old familiar decorations. His hot chocolate steamed beside him as he fitted the last tangram piece into place, completing a perfect swan. His solved dodecahedron rested nearby. The dining room candles were still where he'd placed them, burning steady. He hadn't just seen the pattern. He'd restored it. That was the thing about patterns—they wanted to be whole. And maybe that was his gift. Not just noticing when things were scrambled, but knowing exactly where each piece belonged to make them right again.
