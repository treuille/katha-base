story_beat: James stops, exhausted. The plants are better organized now—but still
  flickering through seasons. James realizes the truth—this isn't about where things
  are, it's about when things are. The room needs rhythm, not routes. They leave,
  knowing their strength wasn't the right tool here.

visual:
  - James standing still among the reorganized plants, hands dirty, expression thoughtful and humbled
  - The plants ARE more organized now—sun plants together, shade plants together—partial success visible
  - But the temporal chaos continues—seasons still flickering across every plant
  - A moment of realization on James's face: this problem isn't about position
  - James looking toward the door, ready to leave but troubled
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette behind a large plant pot on a shelf—frozen crimson figurine silently watching James give up
  - Visual haunting remains high—cold blue light, harsh shadows, geometry still wrong
  - James's shoulders slightly slumped, the forceful confidence dimmed
  - Soil on their hands and knees, evidence of hard work that didn't solve the core problem
  - Neon graphic t-shirt muted under the cold blue light
  - Santa hat askew, ginger hair with blonde streak now messy, freckles visible on their tired face
  - The room behind them as they turn to leave—organized but still broken

  James stopped. Their hands were covered in dirt. The plants were organized now—every one in a sensible spot. But the seasons kept flickering. Winter, summer, spring, fall, all at once, all wrong. "It's not about where," James said slowly. They watched a flower bloom and die in three seconds. "It's about when." The room needed something James couldn't give it. Not a better arrangement. Something else. A rhythm. A beat. James wiped their hands on their sweatpants and walked toward the door. Someone else would have to fix this. The thought stung.
