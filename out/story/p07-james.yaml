  James solved the last equation and the plants parted like a curtain. "Yes!" James shouted, pumping their fist. They started to dance—they couldn't help it—spinning and bouncing with victory. And then, from behind every pot and under every leaf, Jellycat plushies appeared. Bunnies and puppies and bears, all soft and floppy and dancing too! They bounced around James, spinning and wiggling, celebrating together. James laughed so hard their stomach hurt. The sunroom was warm again, filled with golden light and dancing plushies. Math for the win.
