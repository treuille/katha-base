  Despite the library's surrender, Emer senses the haunting isn't fully resolved—
  something bigger pulses through the house. The unicorn fades back to wherever
  it came from, but she carries its magic with her. She needs to find her
  cousins.

visual:
  - Emer back in the hallway, the library peaceful behind her
  - The unicorn fading back through the doorway, turning to nod at her
  - Emer touching her heart where the magic still glows
  - Her expression shifted—still joyful but aware that something bigger remains
  - The hallway warming but still not quite right
  - She's already moving, urgent, toward finding the others
  - Her My Little Pony doll tucked under her arm—toy and real magic, connected now
  - NOTE: Only ONE unicorn—the same one from pages 15-16

  The unicorn faded back to wherever stories live, but Emer felt its magic still glowing in her chest. The library was peaceful now. But something else pulsed through the house—bigger, deeper. "I need to find my cousins," she said, and started running.
