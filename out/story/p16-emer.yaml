  Emer climbs onto the lead unicorn and rises up. Now she's not small anymore—she
  can see the whole library, all the scrambled stories. She becomes the director,
  pointing and calling out, guiding characters home. Her storytelling gift weaves
  a shared ending that ties everyone together. The library yields to her authority.

visual:
  - Emer riding the lead unicorn through the library, elevated above the chaos
  - Her santa hat flying back, arms spread wide, pointing and directing
  - She's laughing with joy and purpose—"You go HERE! She belongs in THAT book!"
  - Unicorns carrying lost characters back to their proper books
  - Story characters following her directions, finding their way home
  - The chaos organizing itself around her commands
  - Warm golden light flooding back into the library
  - Pure triumph and joy on Emer's face—her dream made real, her weakness made strength
