story_beat: The final candle placed. The pattern HOLDS. The candles don't slide
  back—they stay in perfect balance. Arthur realizes he doesn't just see patterns.
  He can RESTORE harmony. Quiet pride, like finishing a perfect solve.

visual:
  - Arthur placing the final candle with intense, urgent precision
  - All candles now arranged in perfect balance around the room
  - The dining room filling with warm golden light, pushing back the cold
  - Candles staying exactly where placed—no sliding, no clustering
  - FOCUS ON EXPRESSION AND POSTURE: Arthur standing with triumphant resolve—shoulders back, chin lifted
  - His expression: intense triumph mixed with worried awareness—he did it but it's not over yet
  - A clear sense that this battle is won but the war continues
  - The formal dining table beautiful again, properly lit
  - Geometry of the room normalized, but hints of wrongness still at the edges
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on the mantelpiece - frozen crimson figurine still present but diminished in the restored harmony

  The last candle clicked into place. Arthur stepped back and watched. The candles didn't slide. They didn't cluster. They stayed exactly where he'd put them, burning steady and calm, the room glowing with warm, balanced light. He'd done it—with clarity and confidence, by seeing where everything belonged. He didn't just notice patterns. He could restore them. That was his power.
