story_beat: Arthur races against the spreading cold, snatching candles and placing
  them with frantic precision. He sees the pattern—the solution—but time is running
  out. His feet pound the floorboards as he rushes from spot to spot, each candle
  placed exactly where it belongs. The warmth fights back.

  - Arthur RUNNING around the dining room, actively moving candles with energy and purpose
  - His body in dynamic motion—reaching, placing, spinning to the next spot
  - OVERLAY: A complex DA VINCI-LIKE MATHEMATICAL PATTERN visible over the scene—intersecting lines, angles, golden ratio spirals, geometric guides showing where each candle belongs
  - The pattern emanates from Arthur's perspective, as if we see the world through his brilliant mathematical mind
  - Candles being placed at precise intersection points of the geometric overlay
  - His expression: JOY—he's having FUN, grinning as he solves the room
  - Warm golden light blooming as each candle finds its mathematically perfect position
  - Cold blue retreating from the edges as harmony is restored
  - Energy and brilliance radiating from him—very active, very smart, loving every second
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette beside the china cabinet - frozen crimson figurine partially obscured as order returns to the room

  Arthur's heart pounded. He could see it—the pattern, the solution—but the cold was spreading fast. He grabbed a candle and slammed it into place. Then he was running, snatching the next one, feet skidding on the wooden floor. "There—and there—and THERE!" Each piece of the puzzle clicking into place like a Rubik's cube in fast-forward. The flames steadied. Warmth surged back. He was going to solve this room.
