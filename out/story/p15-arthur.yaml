story_beat: Arthur begins methodically rearranging candles. Not fighting, not
  commanding—solving. His hands move with quiet precision, each candle placed
  exactly where it belongs. The pattern emerges. Warmth begins returning to the room.

visual: |
  - Arthur RUNNING around the dining room, actively moving candles with energy and purpose
  - His body in dynamic motion—reaching, placing, spinning to the next spot
  - OVERLAY: A complex DA VINCI-LIKE MATHEMATICAL PATTERN visible over the scene—intersecting lines, angles, golden ratio spirals, geometric guides showing where each candle belongs
  - The pattern emanates from Arthur's perspective, as if we see the world through his brilliant mathematical mind
  - Candles being placed at precise intersection points of the geometric overlay
  - His expression: JOY—he's having FUN, grinning as he solves the room
  - Warm golden light blooming as each candle finds its mathematically perfect position
  - Cold blue retreating from the edges as harmony is restored
  - Energy and brilliance radiating from him—very active, very smart, loving every second
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette beside the china cabinet - frozen crimson figurine partially obscured as order returns to the room

  Arthur didn't rush. He picked up the first candle and placed it exactly where it belonged—not where it wanted to go, but where it fit. Then another. And another. His hands moved with the same precision he used on Rubik's cubes, each piece finding its place in the pattern. The flames stopped reaching for the curtains. Warmth crept back into the room. The pattern was emerging.
