story_beat: Close-up on Regan's face as she recognizes it—shocked, worried, and
  surprised in a funny way. Behind her, rainbows, deities, lotuses, and other
  Buddhist imagery shimmer in the air as she realizes what the ornament contains.
  She identifies it as Dorje Legpa, a Gyalpo trickster deity whose nature is
  to scramble things.
