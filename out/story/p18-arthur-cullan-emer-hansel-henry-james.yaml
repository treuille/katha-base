  - IMPORTANT: Only render a single deity (Dorje Legpa)—do not show multiple deities
  - The six cousins RUNNING down the hallway toward the living room—dynamic action, bodies in motion
  - Henry leading the charge, tall figure sprinting with determination
  - James running with Hansel riding piggyback on his back—Hansel clinging on, bouncing with each stride
  - Emer dashing alongside, her messy flowing blonde hair streaming behind her, clutching her My Little Pony doll tight as she runs
  - Cullan and Arthur moving separately, distinctly apart from each other—NOT close together, each running on their own with space between them
  - Every face shows fierce determination—no hesitation, only resolve
  - Legs in mid-stride, arms pumping, the urgency of movement in every figure
  - The hallway blurring past them as they rush toward the living room doorway
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette perched at the edge of the living room doorway - frozen crimson figurine seeming to beckon them toward the final confrontation

  "We have to go back to the living room," Emer said. "NOW."
  "Together," Arthur added—and they ran. All six of them, dashing down the hallway. James scooped up Hansel onto his back. Emer clutched her pony and sprinted. Henry led the way, his long legs eating up the distance. Cullan and Arthur ran side by side but apart, each powering forward on their own. Whatever was in there, they'd face it as a team—and they weren't walking. They were charging.
