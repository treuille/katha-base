story_beat: Close-up on Regan's face as she recognizes it—shocked, worried, and surprised in a funny way. Behind her, rainbows, deities, lotuses, and other Buddhist imagery shimmer in the air as she realizes what the ornament contains. She identifies it as Dorje Legpa, a Gyalpo trickster deity whose nature is to scramble things.

# It should frame a single dramatic image and a single moment in time which makes sense with the story text.

  Regan's eyes went wide. "Oh no," she said, half-laughing, half-worried. Behind her, rainbows and lotuses shimmered in the air. "That's Dorje Legpa. A trickster spirit from Tibetan Buddhism. He scrambles things—wrong seats, wrong rules, wrong places. Someone hung him on our tree by mistake!"
