story_beat: As each kid finishes their room, they drift into the hallway and
  sense that a larger wrongness is still pulsing through the house.

visual: |
  - All six cousins gathering in the hallway from different directions
  - Each looking relieved but uneasy, sensing something still wrong
  - Subtle visual distortions in the hallway—shadows at odd angles
  - The kids drawing together instinctively
  - A faint pulse of wrong-colored light from the direction of the living room
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a high shelf above the kids - frozen crimson figurine with gold crown, looking down at them all unnoticed

  One by one, the cousins found each other in the hallway. Each had discovered a problem in a different room, and they had managed to fix them using their superpowers. But something still felt wrong. The house itself seemed to pulse with a deeper unease. "It's not over," Henry said quietly. They all knew he was right.
