story_beat: As each kid finishes their room, they drift into the hallway and
  sense that a larger wrongness is still pulsing through the house.

visual: |
  - All six cousins gathering in the hallway from different directions
  - Height order from tallest to shortest: Henry, then Cullan and Arthur (same height), then James, then Emer, then baby Hansel
  - Most cousins look CONCERNED and BREATHLESS—they just ran to find each other after solving their rooms, catching their breath, worried expressions
  - EXCEPTION: Hansel retains a BABYLIKE CALM—a serene, wise expression despite the tension around him, intensely understanding the stakes but unruffled
  - James is holding baby Hansel in his arms or on his hip
  - Emer holding her My Little Pony doll tight
  - Subtle visual distortions in the hallway—shadows at odd angles
  - The kids drawing together instinctively
  - A faint pulse of wrong-colored light from the direction of the living room
  - Hansel waving his bottle in agreement from James's arms
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a high shelf above the kids - frozen crimson figurine with gold crown, looking down at them all unnoticed

  One by one, the cousins found each other in the hallway. Each had discovered a problem in a different room, and they had managed to fix them using their superpowers. But something still felt wrong. The house itself seemed to pulse with a deeper unease. "It's not over," Emer said quietly. Hansel waved his bottle in agreement. They all knew she was right.
