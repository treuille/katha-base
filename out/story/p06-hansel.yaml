story_beat: Hansel tries to crawl down anyway and ends up dangling by one arm off
  an impossibly tall stair. He's stuck! His little legs kick in the air. It would
  be scary if it wasn't so funny.

visual:
  - Hansel dangling by one arm off the EDGE of an impossibly tall stair step—funny and precarious, about to tumble onto the next stair below
  - The stairs are magically TALL (about 2 feet high each) but normal depth (9-12 inches)—that's why it's scary that he's hanging off the edge
  - His little legs kicking in the air, bottle clutched in his free hand
  - The stair he's hanging from is comically tall—way bigger than it should be
  - His expression a mix of determination and "uh oh"
  - Christmas stockings visible on the banister nearby—one with "HANSEL" on it
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on the banister—frozen crimson figurine watching
  - EASTER EGG: A small crossed German and French flag ornament hangs from the banister
  - Peak haunting atmosphere—cold harsh light, pools of darkness, proportions warped
  - Frost creeping along the banister and stair railings, ice crystals on the wooden steps
  - Hansel's breath visible in the freezing air
  - The scene funny rather than scary—baby stuck on giant stair

  He tried anyway. One step, two steps—and then he was dangling! His little arm held onto the edge of an impossibly tall stair. His legs kicked in the air. His bottle waved around. This wasn't working at all.
