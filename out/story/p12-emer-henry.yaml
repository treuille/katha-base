  Henry volunteers to tackle the kitchen. He's the baker, the one who follows
  recipes and measures everything properly. Emer gives him a fist bump for luck.

  "I'll fix the kitchen," Henry said. "I'm the baker. I know how to measure things properly and follow recipes." Emer's eyes sparkled. "You're going to teach that kitchen how things are SUPPOSED to work!" They bumped fists. Henry headed toward the kitchen, Emer's encouragement warming his back.
