  They realize each other's strengths fit the other room better. Emer's storytelling
  heart for the scrambled library. Henry's checklist brain for the chaotic kitchen.
  They agree to swap rooms.

visual:
  - A spark of hope on both their faces despite the cold hallway
  - Emer pointing toward the library direction, excited
  - Henry nodding with determination, already mentally making a checklist
  - Their body language shifting from scared to purposeful
  - Emer doing a little bounce of determination
  - A faint warm glow beginning at the edges—hope returning
  - They're about to part ways, each heading to their true challenge

  "Wait—you're good at stories!" Henry's eyes lit up. "The library needs someone who understands characters and endings." Emer gasped. "And you're good at recipes and checklists! The kitchen needs YOU!" They bumped fists. "Swap?" "Swap."
