  Emer rushes toward the library with new understanding and newfound power. From ahead, she hears
  something—whispers, pages rustling, voices calling from wrong stories. But
  something has awakened in her. She doesn't just know stories—she can COMMAND them now.

visual:
  - Emer RUNNING down the hallway toward the library door with URGENCY and SPEED
  - Her body in dynamic motion—feet pounding the floor, moving with fierce PURPOSE
  - Her face shows RESOLVE—chin up, eyes blazing with determination, expression of someone who knows her power
  - A sense of NEWFOUND MAGICAL POWER radiating from her—her story-sense now awakened and glowing
  - Faint sounds visualized as wispy story-fragments floating from the library doorway ahead—but they seem to part for her
  - She clutches her My Little Pony doll like a WAND—a talisman of her awakened strength
  - Her santa hat straight, her whole posture radiating confidence and power
  - Haunting still high but Emer is UNFAZED—she's ready to rewrite this story
  - Tiny Dorje Legpa statuette on a hallway shelf

  Emer ran toward the bookshelves. Something had awakened inside her—she could feel it humming in her chest like magic. The whispers from the library, the pages rustling, the characters calling from wrong stories—they didn't scare her anymore. She squeezed her pony tight, and it felt like holding a wand. "Stories are MY thing," she said out loud, her voice strong. "And I decide how they end."
