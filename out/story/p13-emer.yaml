  Emer walks toward the library with new understanding. From ahead, she hears
  something—whispers, pages rustling, voices calling from wrong stories. But
  this time she knows what she's truly capable of. Stories are her thing.

visual:
  - Emer walking purposefully down the hallway toward the library door
  - Her posture more confident than before—determined, not scared
  - Faint sounds visualized as wispy story-fragments floating from the library doorway ahead
  - She still clutches her My Little Pony doll, but now like a talisman of strength
  - Her santa hat straight, her chin up
  - Haunting still high but her determination growing
  - Tiny Dorje Legpa statuette on a hallway shelf

  Emer marched toward the bookshelves. She could hear it now—whispers, pages rustling, characters calling out from wrong stories. Her heart beat fast, but she squeezed her pony. "Stories are MY thing," she told herself. "I know how they're supposed to end."
