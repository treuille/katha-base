story_beat: After swapping challenges with another cousin, James approaches the hallway
  toward the stairs. But something is already wrong—the hallway doesn't make sense.
  Doors on the wrong sides, the bathroom where the closet should be. James pushes
  forward toward the stairs, sensing a bigger challenge awaits.

visual:
  - James walking down the hallway toward the stairs, visible in the distance
  - The hallway is already wrong—doors on wrong sides, proportions off
  - The bathroom door where the coat closet should be
  - James's expression puzzled but determined—something bigger lies ahead
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a narrow wall shelf—frozen crimson figurine watching
  - Cold blue light seeping through, shadows pooling in wrong places
  - The stairs visible at the end of the hall, already looking strange
  - White graphic t-shirt with neon colors visible
  - Santa hat, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles on determined face
  - James moving forward despite the confusion—leaders don't stop

  The hallway was wrong. James knew this hall—they'd run through it a thousand times. But now the bathroom door was on the wrong side. The coat closet had moved. Even the pictures on the walls seemed tilted, watching. James kept walking. The stairs were ahead, and something about them looked... strange. Like they couldn't quite decide which way was up. James squared their shoulders. Whatever this was, they'd figure it out. They always did.
