story_beat: After swapping rooms with Hansel, James approaches the stairs with new
  understanding. They hear chaos ahead—footsteps going up but arriving down, voices
  calling wrong names. But this time James knows what they're truly capable of. Not
  organizing space—creating ritual.

visual:
  - James walking purposefully down the hallway toward the stairs, visible in the distance
  - Their expression is different now—not forceful control, but thoughtful determination
  - The hallway still wrong—tilted, cold, shadows pooling—but James moves through it with intention
  - Sound seems to emanate from the stairs ahead—visual suggestion of chaotic noise
  - Footprints visible on the hallway floor that go in impossible directions
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a narrow wall shelf beside a lamp—frozen crimson figurine watching James approach the final challenge
  - Haunting still high—cold blue light, harsh shadows—but James's posture suggests they're not afraid
  - James's hands are clean now, but their expression carries the lesson from the sun room
  - White graphic t-shirt with neon colors visible, slightly smudged from earlier
  - Santa hat back in place, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles on determined face
  - The stairs visible at the end of the hall, seeming to shift and twist unnaturally

  James walked toward the stairs. They could hear them before they could see them—footsteps that went up and came down at the same time. Someone calling a name, but it was the wrong name. The stairs were scrambled, just like Hansel had said. But James wasn't thinking about organizing anymore. They were thinking about what Hansel had shown them—how the baby had pointed at things with rhythm, with purpose. How sometimes you couldn't arrange your way out of a problem. Sometimes you had to create something new. A path. A ritual. James reached the bottom of the stairs and looked up.
