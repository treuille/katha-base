story_beat: After swapping challenges with another cousin, James rushes toward the stairs with newfound power.
  The hallway doesn't make sense—doors on wrong sides, the bathroom where the closet should be.
  But something has awakened in James. Their direction-sense is sharper now, almost magical.

  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a narrow wall shelf—frozen crimson figurine watching
  - Cold blue light seeping through, shadows pooling in wrong places—but James cuts through them

  James ran. The hallway was wrong—bathroom on the wrong side, coat closet moved, pictures tilting like they were watching—but James didn't care anymore. Something had awakened in the sun room. A power. They could feel it now: the ability to see through chaos, to find the path when there wasn't one. The stairs ahead looked impossible, twisting in ways stairs shouldn't twist. James smiled. "I'm a leader," they thought, feet pounding the floor. "And leaders don't stop. Leaders find the way." The power hummed inside them, ready.
