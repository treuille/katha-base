story_beat: That evening, James sits by the tree—the real tree now, no strange
  ornaments. They reflect on what they discovered about themselves. By creating
  rituals and paths where none existed, they helped guide the house back to peace.

visual:
  - James sitting by the Christmas tree, bare feet tucked under them
  - The tree looking normal and peaceful—no strange ornaments, just simple decorations
  - Their fingers tapping a quiet rhythm on their knee—the path-making instinct
  - A thoughtful, proud expression—they led today in a new way
  - The living room returned to its natural warmth—cozy and unadorned
  - Warm golden light, everything in its proper place along proper paths
  - Through the window, soft winter evening settling over the snowy woods
  - Their santa hat, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles, neon graphic shirt
  - The sense of paths created and followed, names restored to where they belong

  That evening, James sat by the tree—the real tree now, no strange ornaments. They tapped their fingers on their knee without thinking about it. One-two-three. One-two-three. The stairs were just stairs now. The stockings said the right names. Their stocking—the one with the viola—said "James" again, exactly where it belonged. The house had tried to erase them. Had said they were lost, that they couldn't lead anyone anywhere. But James had made a path out of nothing. Out of rhythm and ritual and pure stubborn knowing. They didn't just follow paths. They made them. And today, that had helped save everyone.
