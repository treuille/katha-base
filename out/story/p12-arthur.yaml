visual: |
  - Arthur RUNNING down the hallway toward the dining room with URGENCY - IMPORTANT: Arthur must be moving TOWARD the dining room (into the frame), not away from it
  - His body in dynamic motion—legs striding fast, arms pumping, moving with PURPOSE and SPEED
  - His face shows RESOLVE—jaw set, eyes blazing with determination, not just focused but FIERCE
  - A sense of NEWFOUND MAGICAL POWER radiating from him—something awakened from his first room victory
  - The hallway still at peak wrongness—cold, tilted, shadows pooling—but Arthur is UNFAZED
  - His Rubik's cube visible in pocket, a reminder of his pattern-skills now AMPLIFIED
  - Shadows on walls recoiling slightly from his determined advance
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette beside a hallway lamp - frozen crimson figurine casting a small shadow, unnoticed by Arthur
