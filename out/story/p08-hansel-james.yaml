  - James thinking Hansel is cute, but also sensing something serious
  - Hansel on the floor with a cute, intent expression—clearly trying to communicate
  - Hansel's bottle raised, pointing intently back toward the stairs

  James stumbled into the hallway and found Hansel waiting. The baby looked up with big serious eyes, pointing his bottle back the way he'd come. James smiled—Hansel was so cute. But something in that intent little face made James pay attention. Hansel was trying to tell them something.
