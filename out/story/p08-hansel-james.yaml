story_beat: Hansel and James meet in the hallway. James is exhausted, covered in
  dirt from moving plants. Hansel points urgently back at the stairs. The hallway
  is at peak wrongness around them—cold, tilted, shadows pooling strangely.

visual:
  - James and Hansel facing each other in the warped hallway
  - James is much taller than baby Hansel, looking down at him
  - James looking exhausted, dirt on their hands and knees from the sun room
  - Hansel on the floor, bottle raised and pointing back toward the stairs
  - Both wearing Santa hats, united in confusion
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a narrow shelf behind the pair—frozen crimson figurine watching them unseen
  - The hallway at peak wrongness—tilted angles, cold blue light, shadows pooling wrong
  - A moment of recognition between the two—both have been through something

  James stumbled into the hallway, dirt on their hands. Hansel was there, pointing urgently back the way he'd come. "The sun room is broken," James said. "Time keeps flickering." Hansel pointed at his own chest, then at the stairs. His face said: me too.
