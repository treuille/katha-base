story_beat: Hansel and James meet in the hallway. James looks down at baby Hansel
  and thinks he's cute—but also senses Hansel is trying to communicate something
  important. Hansel points intently with his bottle toward the stairs.

visual:
  - James and Hansel facing each other in the warped hallway
  - James is much taller than baby Hansel, looking down at him with a soft expression
  - James thinking Hansel is cute, but also sensing something serious
  - Hansel on the floor with a cute, intent expression—clearly trying to communicate
  - Hansel's bottle raised, pointing intently back toward the stairs
  - Both wearing Santa hats
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a narrow shelf behind the pair—frozen crimson figurine watching them unseen
  - EASTER EGG: A small crossed German and French flag ornament hangs askew on the tilted wall
  - The hallway at peak wrongness—tilted angles, cold blue light, shadows pooling wrong

  James stumbled into the hallway and found Hansel waiting. The baby looked up with big serious eyes, pointing his bottle back the way he'd come. James smiled—Hansel was so cute. But something in that intent little face made James pay attention. Hansel was trying to tell them something.
