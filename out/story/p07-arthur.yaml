story_beat: Arthur tries to organize the chaos—matching pieces to boxes, restoring
  basic logic. Things stabilize briefly, but the Scrabble board keeps scrambling.
  He realizes pattern-matching alone won't fix a game rigged at the core. He needs
  to find Cullan.

  - Arthur ACTIVELY MOVING around the room—stacking games, sorting pieces, restoring order
  - His body in motion: reaching for a shelf, sliding a box into place, hands busy
  - Around him: visible progress—chess pieces boxed, cards stacked, board games on shelves
  - The room noticeably LESS HAUNTED than before—warmer light seeping in, geometry stabilizing
  - But the Scrabble board still scrambling in the corner, tiles rearranging themselves
  - His expression: happy with his progress but still worried—the haunting runs deeper than expected
  - Semi-victory atmosphere—shadows retreating, but not gone entirely
  - Energy and purpose in his movements, not defeat
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette sitting on a toy chest - frozen crimson figurine with tiny sword raised, watching Arthur's progress
  - EASTER EGG: Arthur's platonic solid Rubik's cube now neatly placed on a shelf among the restored games, colors looking normal again

  Arthur got to work. He sorted chess pieces into their box. Stacked the scattered cards. Slid board games back onto shelves. The room was calming down—he could feel it. Warmer. Less wrong. But the Scrabble tiles kept scrambling, rearranging into nonsense words. The haunting went deeper than he'd thought. He needed to find Cullan. He had to tell him what just happened.
