story_beat: Arthur tries to organize the chaos—matching pieces to boxes, restoring
  basic logic. Things stabilize briefly, but the Scrabble board keeps scrambling.
  He realizes pattern-matching alone won't fix a game rigged at the core. He needs
  to find Cullan.

  - Arthur standing back from the Scrabble board, breathing hard
  - Around him: some order restored—chess pieces in their box, cards stacked
  - But the Scrabble board still scrambling, tiles rearranging themselves
  - His expression shifting from frustration to realization
  - The room still dominated by cold harsh light, angles wrong
  - High haunting atmosphere—deep shadows, warped geometry
  - His posture defeated but thoughtful, understanding something new
  - Turning toward the door, knowing he needs help
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette sitting on a toy chest - frozen crimson figurine with tiny sword raised, watching Arthur's retreat

  Arthur tried everything. He sorted chess pieces into their box. Stacked the scattered cards. Put game boards back on shelves. For a moment, the room felt calmer. But the Scrabble tiles kept scrambling, rearranging into accusations. He couldn't fix a game that was rigged from the inside. Pattern-matching wasn't enough—not for this. He needed to find Cullan. Maybe together they could figure this out.
