story_beat: All the kids play happily with their favorite toys around the Christmas
  tree in a warm, bustling living room.

visual: |
  - Bustling living room scene with all six cousins scattered around the Christmas tree
  - Arthur solving a comically complicated Rubik's cube - some kind of crazy platonic solid shape, not a simple cube
  - Cullan on his black Windows gaming laptop with colorful RGB glowing keys nearby
  - Henry examining a toy airplane, imagining when he will be a pilot
  - James playing with Jellycat plushies, a phone nearby showing the yellow honeycomb grid of the NYT Spelling Bee puzzle
  - Emer showing a colorful My Little Pony figure to Hansel, who clutches his bottle
  - All background characters wearing Christmas/Santa hats
  - Wrapping paper scattered everywhere, cozy chaos of Christmas morning
  - EASTER EGG: One ornament on the tree is Dorje Legpa - a tiny crimson-red deity figurine with gold crown, turquoise sash, and raised sword, hanging among the regular ornaments - looks like an unusual but inanimate decoration

  The living room buzzes with the special energy of Christmas morning. Arthur twisted his Rubik's puzzle—some crazy shape with too many sides—while Cullan tapped at Fortnite on his glowing laptop. Henry was imagining when he would be a pilot. James cuddled his Jellycat plushies. Emer kept Hansel entertained. Everyone was happy. Everything was perfect. Almost.
