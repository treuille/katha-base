  - Ultra-flat Marin Hanford style with bold colors and busy, joyful composition
  - Warm living room with massive Christmas tree as centerpiece
  - Each child engaged with their favorite activity:
    - Cullan on laptop (Fortnite), blue light on face
    - Arthur with Rubik's cube, concentrating
    - Henry with something airplane-related
    - James orchestrating or directing something
    - Emer with her activity
    - Hansel (baby) with bottle or toy
  - Wrapping paper scattered, presents opened, cozy chaos
  - Tree decorated beautifully, one ornament slightly odd (subtle foreshadowing)
  - Flat warm colors: reds, golds, greens of Christmas

  The living room buzzed with happy chaos. Arthur twisted his Rubik's cube. Cullan hunched over Fortnite. Henry zoomed a toy plane overhead while James directed traffic. Emer played with Hansel, who waved his bottle at the sparkling tree.
