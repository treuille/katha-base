story_beat: That evening, Emer snuggles against her mother Regan by the tree—the real

  the house to peace.

visual:
  - Emer snuggled up against Regan (her mother) by the Christmas tree, cozy and content
  - Both holding mugs of hot chocolate with marshmallows
  - Regan with her long straight blonde hair with pastel pink and rose gold highlights, wearing her taupe hoodie over striped t-shirt
  - Emer's My Little Pony doll held loosely in her lap
  - The tree looking normal and peaceful—no strange ornaments, just simple decorations
  - Her messy flowing blonde hair, beautiful brown eyes soft with wonder
  - A tired but joyful expression—she rode unicorns today and they were real
  - The living room returned to its natural warmth—cozy and unadorned
  - Warm golden light making everything feel like a storybook ending
  - Through the window, soft winter evening settling over the snowy woods
  - Her santa hat, black t-shirt with red heart, pink leggings, white Crocs
  - Regan (adult) is taller than Emer
  - The cozy warmth of mother and daughter sharing hot chocolate together
