  - Ultra-flat Marin Hanford style with bold colors and uneasy atmosphere
  - All six children gathered in the hallway from different directions
  - Each looks relieved but still unsettled—their rooms are fixed, but something's wrong
  - The hallway itself seems to pulse with subtle wrongness—shadows slightly off
  - Children's body language: looking around, sensing, not quite celebrating
  - Cullan and Arthur exchange a knowing glance
  - Flat colors with slightly unsettling undertone—warmth tinged with unease
