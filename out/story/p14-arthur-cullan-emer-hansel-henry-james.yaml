story_beat: As each kid finishes their room, they drift into the hallway and
  sense that a larger wrongness is still pulsing through the house.

visual: |
  - All six cousins gathering in the hallway from different directions
  - Each looking relieved but uneasy, sensing something still wrong
  - Subtle visual distortions in the hallway—shadows at odd angles
  - The kids drawing together instinctively
  - A faint pulse of wrong-colored light from the direction of the living room
