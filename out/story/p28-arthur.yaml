visual:
  - Arthur sitting quietly by the Christmas tree in warm evening light
  - The tree looking normal and peaceful—no strange ornaments, just simple decorations
  - His Rubik's cube in his hands, fingers resting on it thoughtfully
  - A tired but content expression on his face
  - The living room returned to its natural, unadorned warmth—cozy and real
  - Warm golden light from lamps and tree lights, everything in its proper place
  - Through the window, soft winter evening settling over the snowy woods
  - His santa hat slightly askew, messy curly brown hair, quiet confident smile
  - The sense of a puzzle completed, harmony restored

  That evening, Arthur sat by the tree—the real tree now, no strange ornaments. Just lights and tinsel and the old familiar decorations. He turned his Rubik's cube slowly in his hands, not solving it, just feeling the weight of it. The dining room candles were still where he'd placed them, burning steady. He hadn't just seen the pattern. He'd restored it. That was the thing about patterns—they wanted to be whole. And maybe that was his gift. Not just noticing when things were scrambled, but knowing exactly where each piece belonged to make them right again.
