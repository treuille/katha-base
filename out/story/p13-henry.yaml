story_beat: Henry enters the kitchen and finds absolute chaos. The haunted kitchen
  is mixing ingredients together into an abominable concoction—no measuring, no
  recipes, just random ingredients being dumped and stirred. The result looks and
  smells disgusting.

visual:
  - Henry standing in the kitchen doorway, staring at the chaos before him
  - A massive mixing bowl on the counter, ingredients dumping themselves in randomly
  - Flour pouring without measurement, eggs cracking at wrong times, sugar dumping in huge amounts
  - The concoction in the bowl looks absolutely disgusting—brown, lumpy, wrong
  - No measuring cups, no spoons, no recipe in sight—just chaos
  - Ingredients flying through the air with no order whatsoever
  - The fridge positioned to the right of the dishwasher
  - Cold blue light dominant, the kitchen in supernatural disarray
  - Henry's expression: dismay at first, then determination—he knows what's wrong here
  - Santa hat and grey tracksuit standing out against the cold chaotic kitchen
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a high shelf behind jars - frozen crimson figurine watching the chaos

  The kitchen was a disaster. Ingredients were dumping themselves into a giant bowl—flour without measuring, eggs cracking at random, sugar pouring in huge uneven heaps. The concoction inside was brown and lumpy and smelled terrible. No one was following a recipe. No one was measuring anything. It was baking without any of the rules that made baking work. Henry shook his head. "That's not how you make anything."
