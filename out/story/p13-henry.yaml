  Henry ran toward the kitchen. Something had awakened in the library—a power he'd never felt before. His hands still tingled with it. He could hear the chaos ahead—splashing, sloshing, ingredients being dumped together without care. Something in there was destroying the rules of baking. But Henry's precision-sense was sharper now, almost electric. He could feel the right measurements, the correct temperatures, the perfect timing—all of it humming inside him like music. He burst through the doorway ready to bring order to chaos.
