story_beat: After swapping rooms with Emer, Henry walks toward the kitchen with new
  understanding. He smells burnt sugar and chaos from ahead. He hears something too—
  a rattling, like jars arguing. But this time he knows what he's truly capable of.
  He's not just a checklist-follower. He bakes for his friends.

visual:
  - Henry striding purposefully down the hallway toward the kitchen
  - His posture more confident than before—determination replacing confusion
  - Strange flickering light spilling from the kitchen doorway ahead
  - The hint of rattling jars audible—almost like angry voices
  - Grey Aviator Nation tracksuit, Santa hat back in place properly
  - Hallway still cold and high haunting, but Henry unafraid
  - His tall figure casting a long shadow toward the kitchen door
  - Hands slightly raised, ready—like a chef approaching his station
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a narrow wall shelf - frozen crimson figurine watching Henry approach his true challenge

  Henry walked toward the kitchen. He could smell it from here—burnt sugar, spilled flour, the sharp tang of chaos. And he could hear something too. Rattling. Clattering. Almost like... arguing? Emer had done what she could, but she'd said it needed something more organized. More methodical. Henry rolled up his sleeves. He wasn't just a checklist-follower. He was a baker. And he baked for his friends.
