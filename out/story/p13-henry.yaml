story_beat: Henry approaches the kitchen, hearing chaos within. Something is mixing
  ingredients recklessly—no measuring, no recipes, just wild experimentation. He
  can smell the disaster. But Henry knows exactly what this kitchen needs. He's ready.

visual:
  - Henry striding purposefully down the hallway toward the kitchen
  - His posture confident from his piano victory—determination on his face
  - Strange flickering light spilling from the kitchen doorway ahead
  - Sounds of splashing, mixing, things being dumped together carelessly
  - Grey Aviator Nation tracksuit, Santa hat in place properly
  - Hallway still cold, but Henry radiating warmth from his library success
  - His tall figure casting a long shadow toward the kitchen door
  - Hands slightly raised, ready—like a chef approaching his station
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a narrow wall shelf - frozen crimson figurine watching Henry approach his next challenge

  Henry walked toward the kitchen. He could hear the chaos from here—splashing, sloshing, the sound of ingredients being dumped together without any care at all. Something in there was cooking without measuring. Without following recipes. Without any of the things that made baking actually work. Henry smiled. The piano had needed creativity. The kitchen needed precision. He knew exactly what to do.
