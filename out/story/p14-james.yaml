story_beat: |
  James reaches the stairs and they've become impossible—an Escher-like maze
  where up leads down and down leads up. Steps twist and fold in on themselves.
  There's no longer any sense of direction. James tries to climb but ends up
  going sideways, tries to go down but winds up higher. Complete confusion.

visual:
  - James standing on the impossible stairs, looking utterly confused
  - The staircase has become Escher-like—steps going in all directions at once
  - Some stairs lead up but arrive down, others twist sideways into nowhere
  - Steps folding over each other, geometry completely broken
  - James trying to climb but their body tilted at impossible angles
  - No clear up or down visible—all directions equally wrong
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a step—but which way is it facing? Impossible to tell
  - Peak haunting visuals—cold harsh light, deep shadows, warped space
  - James's expression frustrated and lost—for once, they don't know the way
  - Neon graphic shirt looking distorted in the twisted space
  - Santa hat, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles visible on their confused face

  The stairs were impossible. James put their foot on the first step and somehow ended up three steps down. They tried to climb and found themselves going sideways. The whole staircase had become a maze—steps folding over steps, up becoming down becoming nowhere. James turned in a circle, but every direction looked wrong. "Which way?" they whispered. But there was no up. No down. Just endless twisting. For the first time, James had no idea where to go.
