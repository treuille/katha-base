story_beat: Lost in the impossible stairs, James hears a whisper. Not mocking this time—
  gentle. "You're a leader." The words hit James like a flash of understanding. They've
  been letting the stairs lead them. But they're supposed to lead. Leaders don't follow
  the path—they make the path.

visual:
  - James standing with urgent intensity on the impossible stairs, head tilted as if hearing something
  - A light beginning to appear around James—the whisper made visible
  - The words "You're a leader" seeming to shimmer in the air
  - James's expression: intense realization mixed with worried resolve—they understand what they must do
  - The Escher stairs still impossible and threatening around them, but James's posture changing to action
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a twisted step—watching the moment of understanding
  - Warm golden tones beginning to seep in at the edges, but danger still present
  - James's face showing fierce determination—the puzzle solved but the execution still ahead
  - Neon graphic shirt catching the first hints of warm light
  - Santa hat, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles visible
  - The sense of urgent power building within James—no time to waste

  James stood still. Lost. And then they heard it—a whisper, but not like before. Not mocking. Gentle. "You're a leader." The words seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. James felt something click in their brain, like solving a puzzle. They'd been trying to follow the stairs. Trying to figure out which way the stairs wanted to go. But that was backwards. Leaders don't follow. Leaders lead. The stairs weren't supposed to tell James where to go. James was supposed to tell the stairs.
