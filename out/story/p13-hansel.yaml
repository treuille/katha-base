story_beat: Hansel crawls toward the sun room with new purpose. He's already warming
  up—tap-tap-tap on the floor with his bottle. This time he knows his rhythm is
  exactly what's needed. From ahead, he hears the chaos of flickering seasons.

visual:
  - Hansel crawling determinedly down the hallway toward the sun room
  - His bottle tapping the floor in rhythm as he moves—TAP-tap-tap warming up
  - His expression focused and purposeful, not the confusion of before
  - Strange flickering light visible from the sun room doorway ahead
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a narrow wall shelf beside a lamp—frozen crimson figurine watching approach to final challenge
  - The hallway still wrong—cold, tilted—but Hansel moves through with intention
  - His nautical-print sleeper visible, Santa hat firmly on, bottle raised like a baton

  Hansel crawled toward the sun room, his bottle tapping the floor as he went. TAP-tap-tap. TAP-tap-tap. He wasn't confused anymore. James needed paths; Hansel made rhythms. From the room ahead came strange flickering light. His rhythm was ready.
