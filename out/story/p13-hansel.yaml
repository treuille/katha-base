  Hansel crawled fast—faster than he'd ever crawled before. Something had changed in him after the stairs. He could feel it now, like a beat in his chest that matched the beat of the whole house. The hallway was wrong—shadows dancing, light flickering—but Hansel wasn't scared. He knew his power now. The rhythm inside him was ready. He clutched his bottle tight and pushed forward. The sun room was waiting, and so was he.
