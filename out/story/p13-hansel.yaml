story_beat: Hansel crawls toward the sun room with new purpose. This time he knows
  what he's doing. From ahead, he hears rustling and sees strange shadows moving
  against the flickering light.

visual:
  - Hansel crawling determinedly down the hallway toward the sun room
  - His expression focused and purposeful, not the confusion of before
  - Strange flickering light and moving shadows visible from the sun room doorway ahead
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a narrow wall shelf beside a lamp—frozen crimson figurine watching approach to final challenge
  - The hallway still wrong—cold, tilted—but Hansel moves through with intention
  - His nautical-print sleeper visible, Santa hat firmly on
