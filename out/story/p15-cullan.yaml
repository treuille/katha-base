story_beat: Instead of playing by the rigged rules, Cullan stops and speaks with
  authority. He DECLARES what fair means—not fighting, but stating truth. "A fair
  game is one where everyone can win." The game pieces begin to settle and listen.

visual: |
  - Cullan standing tall among the chaos, hands raised, SPEAKING with authority
  - His ice-blue eyes glowing with conviction
  - The accusatory game pieces beginning to SETTLE, lowering their pointing
  - Chess pieces relaxing their aggressive postures
  - Shadows starting to retreat from around him
  - Warm golden light beginning to seep back in at the edges
  - His expression fierce, commanding, discovering his real power
  - The geometry of the room starting to normalize

  Cullan stopped trying to play. He stood up tall and spoke out loud: "A fair game is one where everyone can win." The pointing game pieces wavered. "A fair game doesn't have hidden rules." The chess pawns lowered. "A fair game lets you make mistakes without being destroyed." His voice rang with authority—and slowly, piece by piece, the games began to settle. They were listening.
