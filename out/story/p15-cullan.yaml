story_beat: Instead of playing by the rigged rules, Cullan stops and speaks with
  authority. He DECLARES what fair means—not fighting, but stating truth. "A fair
  game doesn't put words in your mouth." The Scrabble tiles begin to settle and listen.

visual: |
  - Cullan standing tall over the Scrabble board, hands raised, SPEAKING with authority
  - His ice-blue eyes glowing with conviction
  - The accusatory tiles beginning to SETTLE, words dissolving
  - UNFAIR, WRONG, UNTRUE breaking apart, tiles going still
  - Shadows starting to retreat from around him
  - Warm golden light beginning to seep back in at the edges
  - His expression fierce, commanding, discovering his real power
  - The geometry of the room starting to normalize
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a shelf - frozen crimson figurine seeming to lean back as Cullan's authority fills the room

  Cullan stopped trying to play. He stood up tall and spoke out loud: "A fair game is one where everyone can win." The tiles spelling UNFAIR wavered. "A fair game doesn't have hidden rules." The word WRONG broke apart. "A fair game doesn't put words in your mouth." His voice rang with authority—and slowly, tile by tile, the accusations dissolved. The Scrabble board was listening.
