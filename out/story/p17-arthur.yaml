  - His expression shifting from triumph to concern
  - The hallway still wrong but warming—medium haunting level
  - Some warm golden tones returning, but cold still present

  Arthur stepped into the hallway, still warm from his victory. The dining room was peaceful now. But something still pulsed through the walls—a wrongness bigger than any one room. The hallway was warmer than before, but not warm enough. Not safe enough. "This house is completely haunted," he muttered. "I need to find my cousins." And then he ran.
