story_beat: The moment the spirit is pulled into open space, it transforms—his
  flames soften into wind, his weapons turn into sparkles, his screaming face
  relaxes. He remembers he's not a monster but a sky guardian who forgot himself.
  The spirit sees himself reflected in the sky (the sky becomes his mirror).
  The house glows with a gentle protective aura instead of scrambled chaos.

  The moment the spirit touched open sky, everything changed. His icy fury softened into gentle wind. His screaming face relaxed. He saw himself reflected in the endless blue and remembered—he wasn't a monster. He was a sky guardian who had forgotten himself. Sometimes things just need space to be what they're meant to be.
