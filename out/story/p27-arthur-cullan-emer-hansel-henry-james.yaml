  - THIS IS THE CLIMAX IMAGE - spectacular image of pure fun and joy
  - All characters are at the same depth and viewed from the side, moving exactly to the right in the image plane
  - In the right third of the frame, Henry's WWI-style biplane is flying about 10 ft off the ground, and flying to the right.
  - Henry is wearing WWI aviator goggles.
  - Also in the right third, James is under the biplane, dressed like a ground controller, wearing huge hearing protection earmuffs and directing the plan to the right with his glowing rods.
  - In the middle of the frame Cullan and Arthur are in the red wagon which is bouncing down the driveay, being pulled by the airplane by a 15 ft length of string.
  - Henry is happily and confidently looking over his shoulder at the glowing box.
  - The front wheels of the wagon are slight lifted, because of the pull of the airplan, but they're safely on the ground
  - Cullan and Arthur in the wagon, holding the glowing box containing the spirit.
  - In the left third of the frame, Emer following behind the red wagon on her tricycle, Hansel perched on her handlebars
  - All characters are smiling with pure joy, and looking at the glowing box.
  - Hansel POINTING HIS BOTTLE determinedly at the wagon-—guiding them onward
  - The box has burst open opening and out come HUGE RAINBOWS and other dramatic elements behind them filling the sky, the clouds form lotuses and other geometric tibetan imagery.
  - Still clearly in the snowy woods of upstate New York (snow-covered trees visible)
  - Pure delight and triumph on everyone's faces
