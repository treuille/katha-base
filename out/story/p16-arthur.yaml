visual: |
  - Arthur placing the final candle with decisive confidence
  - All candles now arranged in perfect balance around the room
  - The dining room bathed in warm, triumphant golden light
  - Candles staying exactly where placed—no sliding, no clustering
  - FOCUS ON EXPRESSION AND POSTURE: Arthur standing TRIUMPHANT—shoulders back, chin lifted, arms slightly raised in victory
  - This is a BIG MOMENT—his whole body language radiates accomplishment
  - But a subtle hint in his eyes: a flicker of uncertainty, awareness that this might not be over
  - The formal dining table beautiful again, properly lit
  - Geometry of the room normalized, warmth restored
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on the mantelpiece - frozen crimson figurine still present but diminished in the restored harmony

  The last candle clicked into place. Arthur stepped back and watched. The candles didn't slide. They didn't cluster. They stayed exactly where he'd put them, burning steady and calm, the room glowing with warm, balanced light. He'd done it—not with speed, not with commands, but by seeing where everything belonged. He didn't just notice patterns. He could restore them. That was his power.
