  The last candle clicked into place. Arthur stepped back and watched. The candles didn't slide. They didn't cluster. They stayed exactly where he'd put them, burning steady and calm, the room glowing with warm, balanced light. He'd done it—not with speed, not with commands, but by seeing where everything belonged. He didn't just notice patterns. He could restore them. That was his power.
