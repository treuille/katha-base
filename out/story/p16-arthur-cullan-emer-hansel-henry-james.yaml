story_beat: All the kids gather under the tree, sharing quick snapshots of what
  happened in their rooms, and realize everything traces back to the tree.

visual: |
  - All six cousins gathered around the Christmas tree
  - Each gesturing as they share their room experiences
  - Ghostly overlays showing glimpses of each haunting: candles, games, other rooms
  - The tree looming large in the frame, ornaments glinting ominously
  - Growing realization on their faces as patterns connect

text: |
  Under the tree, stories tumbled out. Candles that wouldn't stay lit. Games with impossible rules. Each room had been scrambled in its own way, but now they saw it—all the wrongness radiated from here. From the tree. From something on it.
