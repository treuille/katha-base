story_beat: All the kids gather under the tree, sharing quick snapshots of what happened in their rooms, and realize everything traces back to the tree.

# This should be a few bullet points, each just a few words or a relatively simple sentences long. It will be used as input into the prompt engine.
# DO NOT: Copy / replicate / duplicate any visual information from
#   1. story/template.yaml
#   2. characters/character_id.yaml
#   3. location/location_id.yaml
# as this information will be separately added into the visual prompt.
# It should frame a single dramatic image and a single moment in time which makes sense with the story text.

  - All children gathered under the Christmas tree in a circle
  - Each child gestures describing their room experience
  - Visual echoes of their rooms float above them (dining table, playroom games, etc.)
  - All eyes turn toward the strange ornament on the tree

# This is the text which will be displayed on the storybook pages.
# It should consist of no more than 50 words, including quoted sentences.
