story_beat: All the kids gather under the tree, sharing quick snapshots of what
  happened in their rooms, and realize everything traces back to the tree.

visual: |
  - Ultra-flat Marin Hanford style with bold colors and dramatic composition
  - All six children gathered around the Christmas tree
  - They're talking rapidly, sharing stories, gesturing to explain
  - Quick visual snapshots floating around them showing their room experiences
  - All attention gradually focusing on the tree—specifically one ornament
  - The strange ornament seems to glow or pulse subtly
  - Flat colors with tree as dramatic centerpiece, children as united group

  Under the tree, stories tumbled out. Candles. Games. Wrong seats. Broken rules. Every strange thing traced back here—to the tree, to one ornament that none of them remembered hanging. It pulsed with faint, wrong light.
