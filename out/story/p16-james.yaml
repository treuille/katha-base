story_beat: The stairs are fixed—perfectly normal now. James stands triumphant at the
  top, still feeling the magic tingling in their fingertips. They did it. They led
  the stairs back to reality. But even in victory, something feels unresolved. A
  hint of cold still pulses through the house. There's more to do.

visual:
  - James standing triumphantly at the top of the now-normal stairs
  - The staircase completely fixed—proper geometry, steps going the right way
  - James's hands still faintly glowing with residual magic
  - Triumphant expression, but eyes showing awareness of something more
  - The stairs behind them looking ordinary and safe
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a shelf—smaller now, diminished but still watching
  - Mostly warm golden light, but a thread of cold blue visible deeper in the house
  - A subtle pulse of wrongness in the air—the challenge is won but the war continues
  - Neon graphic shirt vibrant, Santa hat proud on their head
  - Ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles on their triumphant but vigilant face
  - James's posture confident—they know their power now

  The stairs were fixed. James stood at the top, breathing hard, and looked back. Normal stairs. Regular steps going regular directions. They'd done it. Magic still tingled in their fingertips—real magic, their magic. They were more powerful than they'd ever known. But even as warmth flooded back into the stairwell, James felt something else. A cold thread still running through the house. A pulse of wrongness, deeper inside. This wasn't over. But James knew something now: whatever came next, they could lead their way through it.
