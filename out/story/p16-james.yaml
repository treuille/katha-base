story_beat: James raises their hands and points. Magic flows through them—real magic,
  power they never knew they had. "UP is UP!" they command, pointing toward the ceiling.
  "DOWN is DOWN!" pointing at the floor. The impossible stairs shudder, twist, and
  slowly begin to straighten. James is leading the stairs back to normal.

visual:
  - James standing powerfully on the stairs, both arms raised, pointing in different directions
  - One hand pointing UP toward the ceiling, golden light streaming from their fingers
  - Other hand pointing DOWN toward the floor, more golden light
  - Magic visibly flowing through James—they're glowing with power
  - The Escher stairs UNTWISTING—steps rotating back into proper position
  - Geometry slowly correcting itself as James commands
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette tumbling on a step as reality reshapes
  - Warm golden light flooding in, cold blue being pushed away
  - James's expression fierce and triumphant—they're in control now
  - Neon graphic shirt glowing bright in the magical light
  - Santa hat, ginger hair with blonde streak flying with power, freckles visible
  - The sense of leadership and command radiating from James

  James raised their hands. They didn't know what they were doing—it just felt right. They pointed up with one hand, down with the other. "UP is UP!" their voice rang out, stronger than they'd ever heard it. "DOWN is DOWN!" Something happened. Magic—real magic—poured through their fingers like golden light. The stairs shuddered. Groaned. And slowly, impossibly, they began to straighten. Steps untwisted. The Escher maze unwound. James felt power surging through them, power they never knew they had. They were leading the stairs. And the stairs were listening.
