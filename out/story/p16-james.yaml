location: stairs

story_beat: The stairs yield completely. James speaks their ritual like a spell, moves
  like a dance. The stockings shuffle back to their rightful names. The looping stops.
  James realizes they don't just know the right path—they can create paths that didn't
  exist before.

visual:
  - James mid-stride on the stairs, moving with graceful purpose—almost dancing up the steps
  - The staircase transformed—geometry normal, steps going properly up, warm golden light flooding in
  - All the stockings now showing CORRECT names—James's stocking prominently displaying "JAMES" with the viola design
  - James's face showing quiet triumph and wonder—a new understanding of their power
  - The movement captured mid-ritual—one hand tapping banister, feet in deliberate pattern
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on the windowsill at the stair landing—frozen crimson figurine diminished in the warm golden light
  - Warm colors dominant now—rich golds, cozy Christmas reds, the cold blue fully retreated
  - But some tension still visible in the air—this room is fixed but something bigger remains
  - James reaching the top of the stairs successfully—the loop broken
  - Neon graphic shirt vibrant and bold in the restored warm light
  - Santa hat proud on their head, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles on their triumphant face
  - The sense of a path created—not forced, but designed

  "Up means up. Down means down. Each step takes us where we're bound." James moved as they spoke, tapping and stepping, tapping and stepping. It was like the best kind of game—one with rules that made everything make sense. The stairs stopped looping. The geometry straightened. And the stockings—one by one, they flickered. Arthur's stocking said "Arthur." Cullan's said "Cullan." And James's stocking, with the tiny embroidered viola, said "James." Their name. Their place. They reached the top and looked back down. The staircase was just a staircase now. But James knew something new: they didn't just follow paths. They could make them.
