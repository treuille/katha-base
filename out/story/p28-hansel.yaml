story_beat: That evening, Hansel sits by the tree—the real tree now, no strange
  ornaments. He reflects in his baby way on what happened. His simple, genuine joy
  helped bring rhythm back to the chaos and restore peace to the house.

visual:
  - Hansel sitting contentedly by the Christmas tree, bottle in hand
  - The tree looking normal and peaceful—no strange ornaments, just simple decorations
  - His baby bottle pointing gently at the tree lights, watching them twinkle
  - A happy, peaceful expression—his natural sunny state restored
  - The living room returned to its natural warmth—cozy and real
  - Warm golden light, everything calm and rhythmic—no flickering, no chaos
  - Through the window, soft winter evening settling over the snowy woods
  - His santa hat, white nautical-print sleeper, muslin bib—pure baby contentment
  - The sense of rhythm found, joy proven true and good

  That evening, Hansel sat by the tree—the real tree now, no strange ornaments. He pointed his bottle at the lights. TAP-tap-tap. They twinkled back at him, steady and warm. Earlier, the house had tried to tell him his joy was wrong. That his clapping broke things. But that wasn't true. His joy was just... joy. Simple and real. And when he'd offered it—not fighting, just being happy—the sun room had remembered how to be peaceful. He clapped softly, and his cousin James smiled at him from across the room. Hansel smiled back. Everything was exactly as it should be.
