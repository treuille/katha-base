story_beat: Working together, the children grab the blazing deity and wrestle it
  into a box. The spirit is furious, shining light through every crack, but
  contained. Simple collective action, funny and chaotic.

visual: |
  - Big chaotic action spread showing all six kids working together
  - The children grabbing the blazing spirit with their bare hands
  - Wrestling the furious deity into a large wooden box
  - Light blazing out through every crack and gap in the box
  - The spirit hilariously indignant, wiggling and complaining but contained
  - Warmth returning to the room as the spirit is boxed

  "Grab him!" Everyone moved at once. Six pairs of hands seized the blazing, wiggling spirit and wrestled it toward a big wooden box. The deity complained loudly, shooting light through every crack, but they got the lid closed. It looked absolutely ridiculous—a glowing, shaking box full of angry trickster god.
