story_beat: That evening, James sits by the tree with hot cocoa, content and sleepy.
  They reflect on the magic they discovered within themselves—more powerful than
  they ever knew. As sleep begins to take them, they wonder drowsily about all
  the things they might be able to lead... even airplanes.

visual:
  - James curled up by the Christmas tree, looking content and sleepy
  - A mug of hot cocoa warming their hands, steam rising gently
  - Eyes half-closed, a peaceful smile on their face
  - The tree normal and beautiful—no strange ornaments
  - Warm golden light, cozy and safe
  - Through the window, soft winter evening
  - Santa hat, ginger hair with blonde streak, freckles
  - EASTER EGG: A Jellycat plushie snuggled next to James—a favorite comfort companion for the cozy moment
  - The sense of deep contentment and discovered power

  James curled up by the tree with hot cocoa, warm and sleepy. They were more powerful than they'd ever known. Real magic, their magic. Their eyes grew heavy. "I wonder," they murmured, drifting toward sleep, "if I could learn to direct airplanes..." The thought floated away as dreams took over. Safe. Content. A leader, even in sleep.
