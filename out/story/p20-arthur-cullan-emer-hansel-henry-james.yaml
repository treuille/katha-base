# This should be a few bullet points, each just a few words or a relatively simple sentences long. It will be used as input into the prompt engine.
# DO NOT: Copy / replicate / duplicate any visual information from
#   1. story/template.yaml
#   2. characters/character_id.yaml

# as this information will be separately added into the visual prompt.
# It should frame a single dramatic image and a single moment in time which makes sense with the story text.
