story_beat: In a big action spread, each child uses their room-discovered superpower
  to contain the spirit. They tie it onto the bright red sled—still blazing
  and hilarious, complaining and wiggling. Very funny.

  Everyone moved at once. Arthur found the pattern to approach safely. Cullan made sure the containment was fair—"Even trickster spirits deserve proper treatment!" They wrestled the blazing, wiggling, loudly-complaining deity onto Graminy's red sled. It looked absolutely ridiculous.
