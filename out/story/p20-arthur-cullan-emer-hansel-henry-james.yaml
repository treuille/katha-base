story_beat: Henry points at the odd ornament on the tree, drawing everyone's
  attention to it.

visual: |
  - DRAMATIC COMPOSITION: Henry in the FOREGROUND, his EYELINE follows his pointed FINGER creating a strong visual line leading directly to the deity ornament—this is the key focal element
  - Henry (tallest of the cousins) standing firm, arm extended, finger pointing at the ornament, eyes locked on it
  - The ornament IS Dorje Legpa - crimson-red deity figurine with gold crown, turquoise sash, tiny raised sword, now glowing with an unsettling inner light
  - ALL OTHER COUSINS in the BACKGROUND, following Henry's finger with their gaze, eyes tracing that same line to the ornament
  - The cousins look WARY but DETERMINED—sensing danger while standing firm, not just curious but ready to face what's coming
  - The Dorje Legpa ornament distinctly different from the others—wrong and pulsing with energy
  - The composition feels staged and dramatic—Henry's pointing arm creates the visual anchor, cousins arrayed behind him, all gazes converging on the glowing ornament

  "There." Henry's voice was steady as he pointed at the tree. One ornament hung slightly crooked, glowing with a strange inner light that didn't match the others. It seemed to pulse, almost breathing. "That's what's wrong."
