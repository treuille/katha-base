  - Arthur and Cullan meeting in the hallway, both looking shaken

  - On other side: scattered game pieces and broken board game boxes
  - Both boys gesturing animatedly as they compare stories

  "Cullan!" Arthur rushed down the hall. "The playroom is haunted—games keep changing their own rules!"
  "The dining room too," Cullan said. "Candles won't stay lit and nothing's in the right place."
  They stared at each other. This was bigger than either of them thought.
