story_beat: Cullan bumps into Arthur in the hall. The hallway is at peak wrongness—
  cold, tilted, shadows pooling strangely. Cullan describes the fire danger he just
  faced in the dining room.

visual:
  - "IMPORTANT: Show CULLAN on the LEFT side of frame with his tousled curly DARK BLONDE hair. Show ARTHUR on the RIGHT side of frame with his messy curly BROWN hair."
  - Cullan and Arthur just ran into each other in the hallway
  - Both look triumphant from solving their first puzzles, but also tired and a little worried
  - Cullan gesturing urgently, describing what he saw, still catching his breath
  - Arthur listening intently, face showing concern
  - Arthur and Cullan are the same height, standing eye-to-eye
  - Cullan's santa hat askew
  - Medium haunting atmosphere—cold blue tones emerging, harsh shadows, geometry slightly off
  - Frost creeping across surfaces, cold blue light, crooked picture frames and tilted doorframes
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette perched on a narrow shelf behind the boys - frozen crimson figurine with gold crown and tiny sword, watching them unseen
  - EASTER EGG: Arthur's platonic solid Rubik's cube visible in his hand—a comfort object he carries everywhere

  Cullan nearly ran into Arthur in the hallway. "Arthur! The dining room—all the candles clustered together in one corner. They set the curtains on fire! I tried moving them, but they keep sliding back."
