  - Cullan and Arthur meeting in the hallway, both looking shaken
  - Hallway at PEAK HAUNTING - cold blue light, harsh shadows, geometry warped
  - Doorframes visibly tilted, proportions wrong, uncanny
  - Cullan gesturing urgently, describing what he saw
  - Arthur listening intently, face showing concern
  - Cullan's santa hat askew, still catching his breath
  - The wrongness of the hallway surrounding them both

  Cullan nearly ran into Arthur in the hallway. "Arthur! The dining room—all the candles clustered together in one corner. They almost set the curtains on fire! I tried moving them, but they keep sliding back."
