visual: |
  - Ultra-flat Marin Hanford style with bold colors and clean graphic shapes
  - Cullan and Arthur face each other in the hallway, both gesturing animatedly
  - Ghostly transparent thought-bubbles between them showing their experiences:
    - Cullan's side: candles going out in spirals, the giant match, crooked chairs
    - Arthur's side: jumbled game pieces, dice with wrong numbers, frustrated board games
  - Both boys look slightly frazzled but excited to share
  - Their expressions show the relief of finding someone who understands
  - Flat color palette: warm hallway tones, translucent memory overlays

  "The dining room candles kept blowing out!" Cullan said. "I lit them all, but the chairs are still wrong." Arthur nodded eagerly. "The playroom games are broken—pieces everywhere, rules that make no sense. I sorted them, but they still feel rigged."
