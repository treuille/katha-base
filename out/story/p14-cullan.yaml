story_beat: The Scrabble board attacks Cullan—not twisting his words like it did to
  Arthur, but spelling out accusations. Tiles rearrange to spell CHEATER, LIAR, FRAUD.
  The game is framing him, making him the villain.

visual: |
  - Cullan standing over the Scrabble board, looking horrified
  - Tiles on the board rearranging themselves to spell CHEATER
  - More tiles sliding to form LIAR, FRAUD, pointing at him
  - The wooden tile rack spelling accusations directly at Cullan
  - Shadows pooling around him, isolating him as the "guilty one"
  - His expression shifting from confusion to horror—he's being framed
  - Cold harsh light, geometry deeply wrong
  - The same board that attacked Arthur now attacking him differently

  Cullan stepped toward the Scrabble board—the same one that had twisted Arthur's words. But it attacked him differently. The tiles slid and rearranged, spelling out words: CHEATER. LIAR. FRAUD. Every accusation pointed at him. He hadn't even touched the board, and already it was framing him as the villain. The room wasn't twisting his words. It was putting words in his mouth.
