story_beat: The playroom attacks Cullan in a new way—not erasing him, but framing him.
  Every game is rigged so HE looks like the cheater. Dice roll double sixes when he
  touches them. Game pieces arrange themselves to point blame at him.

visual: |
  - Cullan standing amid scattered board games, looking horrified
  - Dice in his hand showing DOUBLE SIXES—as if he rigged them
  - Cards in his other hand changing suits before his eyes
  - Game pieces POINTING at him like accusing fingers
  - Chess pieces turned to face him, pawns arranged in blame formation
  - Shadows pooling around him, isolating him as the "guilty one"
  - His expression shifting from confusion to horror—he's being framed
  - Cold harsh light, geometry deeply wrong

  Cullan picked up a pair of dice, and they immediately rolled double sixes. He grabbed a card, and it changed suits in his hand. All around the room, game pieces swiveled to point at him—chess pawns, checkers, even the little metal dog from Monopoly. Everything was arranged to make him look guilty. The room was framing him as a cheater.
