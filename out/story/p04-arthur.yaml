story_beat: Arthur follows a strange pull toward the playroom. The hallway feels
  geometrically wrong—doorframes don't meet at right angles, warm Christmas colors
  draining to cold blues. His pattern-brain screams that something is deeply off.

visual: |
  - Arthur standing in the hallway, head tilted, studying the geometry
  - Looking toward the playroom with growing unease
  - The hallway's doorframes visibly WRONG—angles that don't add up to 90 degrees
  - Warm Christmas colors draining away, replaced by cold blue tones
  - His expression analytical but troubled—he SEES the wrongness
  - Light pooling in impossible places, shadows falling at wrong angles
  - His breath coming out in a small frost cloud
  - Rubik's cube clutched in one hand, forgotten
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette sitting on a hall table, partially hidden behind a decorative bowl - frozen crimson figurine with gold crown and tiny sword, completely still

  Something pulled Arthur toward the playroom. The hallway felt wrong. Not just cold—geometrically wrong. That doorframe wasn't ninety degrees. That shadow fell the wrong direction. His pattern-brain screamed at him: none of this adds up. The warm Christmas colors were draining away, replaced by cold blue. He kept walking anyway.
