story_beat: Hansel reaches the stairs and tries to crawl down, but something is wrong.
  With each step he takes, the stairs seem to grow steeper. What started as normal
  stairs is becoming impossibly vertical. He can't go down.

visual:
  - Hansel at the top of the stairs, looking down at the impossibly steep descent
  - The stairs growing steeper and steeper as they go down—almost vertical
  - Christmas stockings hung on the banister, one prominently showing "HANSEL"
  - Hansel's expression shifting from determination to worry as he realizes he can't crawl down
  - EASTER EGG: Tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette on a stair shelf—frozen crimson figurine watching
  - The staircase seeming to stretch and distort, each step taller than the last
  - Peak haunting atmosphere—cold harsh light, pools of darkness, proportions warped
  - Frost creeping along the banister, ice crystals forming on the stair railings
  - Hansel's breath visible in the freezing air
  - Hansel clutching his bottle, trying to figure out what to do

  Hansel wanted to go downstairs. But the stairs were wrong. Each step was taller than the last. By the time he looked down, they stretched almost straight down like a cliff. He couldn't crawl down that!
