story_beat: Henry follows a strange pull toward the library—maybe he wants to check
  Graminy's old pilot manuals, or just needs to think. The hallway feels subtly wrong.
  Warm Christmas colors drain away, replaced by cold blues. His breath frosts slightly.

visual:
  - Henry walking down the hallway toward the library, laptop tucked under one arm
  - Tall figure in grey Aviator Nation tracksuit, the five-stripe pattern visible on his sweatpants
  - Santa hat still on, expression shifting from curious to uneasy
  - The hallway's warm Christmas colors visibly DRAINING, being replaced by cold blue tones
  - Light pooling in wrong places, creating harsh shadows
  - Christmas decorations on the wall looking slightly tilted, proportions off
  - His breath coming out in a small cloud of frost—temperature dropping
  - The angles of doorframes and walls not quite matching up, subtly uncanny
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette tucked behind a picture frame on the hallway wall - frozen crimson figurine with gold crown and tiny sword, completely still and inanimate

  Something pulled Henry toward the library. Maybe he wanted to check Graminy's old flying books. Maybe he just needed to think. But the hallway felt wrong. The Christmas lights seemed dimmer here, their warm colors draining away into cold blue. His breath came out in a little puff of frost. The family photos on the wall hung crooked, and the doorframe ahead looked... tilted? The house itself seemed to be holding its breath.
