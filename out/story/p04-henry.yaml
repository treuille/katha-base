  arm. He's trying to text his friend, but his phone is frosting over and shows zero
  bars. The hallway feels subtly wrong. Warm Christmas colors drain away.

visual:
  - Henry walking down the hallway toward the library, the massive flight manual tucked under one arm
  - In his other hand, his phone—screen visibly frosting over with ice crystals, the signal indicator showing zero bars
  - His expression confused and uneasy as he looks at the frozen phone
  - Tall figure in grey Aviator Nation tracksuit, the five-stripe pattern visible on his sweatpants
  - Santa hat still on, expression shifting from curious to uneasy
  - The hallway's warm Christmas colors visibly DRAINING, being replaced by cold blue tones
  - Light pooling in wrong places, creating harsh shadows
  - Christmas decorations on the wall looking slightly tilted, proportions off
  - His breath coming out in a small cloud of frost—temperature dropping
  - The angles of doorframes and walls not quite matching up, subtly uncanny
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette tucked behind a picture frame on the hallway wall - frozen crimson figurine with gold crown and tiny sword, completely still and inanimate

  Something pulled Henry toward the library. He tried to text his friend back, but his phone had gone strange—frost spreading across the screen, the signal bars dropping to zero. He tapped at it uselessly. The hallway felt wrong too. The Christmas lights seemed dimmer here, their warm colors draining away into cold blue. His breath came out in a little puff of frost. The family photos on the wall hung crooked. The house itself seemed to be holding its breath.
