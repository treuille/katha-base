story_beat: Instead of trying to fix the piano, Henry decides to work with it. He
  starts experimenting, finding notes that sound good together despite being in wrong
  places. He begins to invent a strange new melody—beautiful in its own way.

visual:
  - Henry seated at the scrambled piano, leaning forward with interest instead of frustration
  - His fingers exploring the chaos of keys, finding unexpected harmonies
  - A look of dawning discovery on his face—this is working
  - The scrambled keyboard still wrong, but Henry adapting to it
  - Notes seeming to float in the air around him—some discordant, but some surprisingly beautiful
  - The cold blue still dominant, but small hints of warmth beginning at the edges
  - His posture shifting from tense to creative, experimental
  - Sheet music ignored—he's making something new
  - Santa hat slightly tilted, his goofy smile emerging
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette among books on a high shelf - frozen crimson figurine watching intently

  Henry's fingers hovered over the scrambled keys. Trying to play normal music was useless—the notes were all in wrong places. But what if he didn't try to play normal music? He pressed a random key. Then another. And another. Some combinations sounded terrible. But some... some sounded interesting. Strange. New. He leaned forward and started experimenting. Maybe this broken piano could teach him a melody no one had ever heard before.
