story_beat: Instead of trying to fix the piano, Henry decides to work with it. He
  starts experimenting, pressing crooked keys and hovering keys, finding notes that sound good
  together despite the chaos. He begins to invent a strange new melody—beautiful in its own way.

visual:
  - The piano is a traditional UPRIGHT WOODEN PIANO—vertical body with warm wooden casing, standing against the library wall (NOT a grand piano, NOT electronic)
  - A blue binder of sheet music open on the music stand, messy stacks of books piled on top of the piano
  - An upright cello on a stand next to the piano
  - Henry seated at this old wooden upright, leaning forward with interest instead of frustration
  - His fingers exploring the chaos—pressing tilted keys, tapping hovering keys, working around gaps
  - A look of dawning discovery on his face—this is working
  - The keyboard still impossibly wrong—keys at crooked angles, black and white unevenly distributed—but Henry adapting to it
  - Notes seeming to float in the air around him—some discordant, but some surprisingly beautiful
  - The cold blue still dominant, but small hints of warmth beginning at the edges
  - His posture shifting from tense to creative, experimental
  - The blue binder of sheet music ignored—he's making something new
  - Santa hat slightly tilted, his goofy smile emerging
  - EASTER EGG: A tiny 6-inch Dorje Legpa statuette among books on a high shelf - frozen crimson figurine watching intently

  Henry's fingers hovered over the chaos. Keys stuck out at crooked angles. Some trembled in mid-air. Trying to play normal music on this mad wooden upright was useless. But what if he didn't try to play normal music? He pressed a tilted key. Then a hovering one. Then another. Some combinations sounded terrible. But some... some sounded interesting. Strange. New. He leaned forward and started experimenting. Maybe this broken piano could teach him a melody no one had ever heard before.
