story_beat: Cullan and Arthur ride in the sled being dragged by the airplane,
  holding the deity in a box. Emer trails behind on a tricycle with Hansel on
  the handlebars, pointing exultantly at the sky with his bottle. The plane
  lifts the sled—not too high, just enough for comedic effect—dragging it across
  the lawn, up over a little bump, maybe through some clouds.

visual: |
  - The WWII-style biplane dragging the red sled across the snowy lawn
  - Cullan and Arthur in the sled, holding a glowing box containing the spirit
  - The spirit now appearing KIND, BENEVOLENT, and WISE as it begins to transform
  - The sled lifting slightly off the ground—just enough to be magical
  - The air filled with frosty Tibetan imagery - lotuses, rainbow light, peaceful deity forms
  - Behind them, Emer on a tricycle with Hansel on handlebars
  - Hansel pointing his bottle triumphantly at the sky, pure joy on his face

  The airplane pulled the sled across the snow, then lifted—just a little, just enough. Cullan and Arthur held tight to the spirit's box as they bumped through a low cloud. Behind them, Emer pedaled furiously on a tricycle while Hansel waved his bottle at the sky, laughing.
