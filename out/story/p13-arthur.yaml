story_beat: Arthur walks toward the dining room with new understanding. From ahead,
  he sees flickering orange light, smells heat. His pattern-brain is already working
  on what he'll find—Cullan described clustered candles, fire danger. But Arthur
  sees problems differently.

visual: |
  - Arthur striding down the hallway toward the dining room
  - His posture determined, analytical, knowing what awaits
  - Flickering orange light spilling from the dining room doorway ahead
  - The hallway still at peak wrongness—cold, tilted, shadows pooling
  - His expression focused, mind already working on the problem
  - Contrast: cold blue hallway vs. warm orange glow from dining room
  - His Rubik's cube visible in pocket, a reminder of his pattern-skills
  - Shadows on walls, but Arthur walking with purpose

  Arthur walked toward the dining room, but differently this time. He knew what waited—Cullan had described the clustered candles, the fire danger. But where Cullan saw chaos, Arthur saw a puzzle. The flickering orange light ahead was just another pattern waiting to be solved. His mind was already working: how do you balance something that refuses to stay balanced?
