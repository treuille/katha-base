story_beat: The kids look at the shaking, glowing box and realize it won't hold
  for long. Henry has an idea - he remembers pulling a little red wagon to Millbrook
  last summer, but he has something better in mind. He asks where his pilot goggles are.

visual: |
  - The living room with all six cousins gathered around the glowing, shaking wooden box - NOTE: Ensure this is the SAME box from p24, not a second box
  - Light blazing through every crack in the box, the spirit contained but furious
  - Height order visible: Henry tallest, Cullan and Arthur same height, then James, then Emer, then baby Hansel
  - Worried expressions on the kids' faces as they realize the box won't hold
  - Henry's face lighting up with sudden inspiration
  - Looks of delight spreading across the other kids' faces as they realize what Henry is proposing
  - EVERYONE wearing Santa hats

  The box shook and rattled. Light blazed through every crack. "This won't hold!" someone said. They all looked at each other, uncertain. Then Henry's eyes lit up. "Remember when I pulled the little red wagon all the way to Millbrook last summer? Well, I have a better idea." He grinned. "Where are my pilot goggles?"
