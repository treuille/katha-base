  Outside in the snow, Henry climbed into his small airplane—a proper WWII-style biplane with an open cockpit and a propeller in front. He'd found some flight goggles somewhere and pushed them up on his forehead, though he kept his Santa hat firmly in place. James took position on the ground, all business. "Spirit Sled Three-Seven-Red," he announced in his best pilot voice, "you are cleared for takeoff!"
