story_beat: The kids look at the shaking, glowing box and realize it won't hold
  for long. Henry has an idea and takes charge - he tells the others to get the box
  in the wagon and take it outside. He's going to run and get his pilot goggles.
  The others are puzzled but start to act.

  - NOTE: Ensure this is ONE box, the SAME box from p24—not multiple boxes
  - The living room with all six cousins gathered around the single wooden box CRACKLING WITH RAINBOW ENERGY—visible rainbow-colored magical energy arcing and sparking from every crack
  - The box shaking violently, rainbow light blazing through every gap, the spirit contained but furious
  - Height order visible: Henry tallest, Cullan and Arthur same height, then James, then Emer, then baby Hansel
  - Henry TAKING CHARGE—pointing, giving instructions, about to run off (still in scene but clearly about to bolt)
  - The other kids look PUZZLED but are starting to act on his instructions
  - Arthur and Cullan moving toward the box, ready to lift it
  - Emer picking up Hansel, preparing to move
  - James looking at Henry with a mix of confusion and trust
  - Sense of URGENCY—they need to move fast
  - EVERYONE wearing Santa hats

  The box shook and rattled. Light blazed through every crack. "This won't hold!" someone said. Then Henry's eyes lit up. "Get the box in the wagon! Take it outside—I have an idea!" He was already moving toward the door. "I need to get my pilot goggles!" The others stared after him. Pilot goggles?
