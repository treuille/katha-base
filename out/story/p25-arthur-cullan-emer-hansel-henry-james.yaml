  - NOTE: Ensure this is ONE box, the SAME box from p24—not multiple boxes
  - The living room with all six cousins gathered around the single wooden box CRACKLING WITH RAINBOW ENERGY—visible rainbow-colored magical energy arcing and sparking from every crack
  - The box shaking violently, rainbow light blazing through every gap, the spirit contained but furious
  - Height order visible: Henry tallest, Cullan and Arthur same height, then James, then Emer, then baby Hansel
  - Henry's face lighting up with sudden inspiration—he has an idea!
  - James with his mind BLOWN—eyes wide, jaw dropped, amazed and excited by Henry's plan, the lightbulb moment hitting him
  - Hansel sucking on his bottle intently, eyes wide and following everything, focused on the situation despite being a baby, ready to help
  - The other kids' faces shifting from worry to excitement as they realize what Henry is proposing
  - EVERYONE wearing Santa hats

  The box shook and rattled. Light blazed through every crack. "This won't hold!" someone said. They all looked at each other, uncertain. Then Henry's eyes lit up. "Remember when I pulled the little red wagon all the way to Millbrook last summer? Well, I have a better idea." He grinned. "Where are my pilot goggles?"
