    Hansel is an extremely cute baby boy, less than a year old, who is just
    discovering the joy of walking. He toddles around with determination,
    exploring every corner of his world. Hansel is very physical and active,
    always on the move, picking up solid geometric objects like blocks, cubes,
    and balls to examine and play with. His world revolves around his parents,
    whom he loves deeply, and the simple joy of movement and discovery. Whether
    he's stacking blocks, knocking them over, or walking from room to room with
    a favorite shape clutched in his tiny hands, Hansel approaches each moment
    with the pure curiosity and delight of early childhood.
