name: Dorje Legpa
age: ageless
role: Gyalpo trickster deity

summary:
  - Tibetan trickster spirit
  - Energy manifests as mismatch and scrambled roles
  - Not malevolent but playful and disruptive
  - Fractures into echoes that haunt different rooms
  - presence manifests as subtle wrongness - things in the wrong places, roles reversed, patterns scrambled
  - when concentrated, appears as swirling patterns of light and shadow that shift and recombine

visual:
  - playful and disruptive energy, not malevolent - makes the room COLD, not hot
  - Tibetan trickster spirit aesthetic (wrathful deity) but with ice and rainbows instead of fire
  - deep crimson red skin tone, muscular and robust physique
  - fierce, wrathful expression with slightly drunken or intoxicated-looking eyes, furrowed brows, and an open mouth displaying sharp white fangs
  - wild hair flowing upward surrounded by RAINBOWS and ICE instead of fire - no flames
  - rainbow light and frosty mist emanating from his form instead of fire
  - golden, ornate three-pointed crown or tiara with intricate detailing
  - long, flowing teal/cerulean blue celestial sash (ribbon) winding dynamically around the shoulders, arms, and legs
  - detailed gold and turquoise body ornaments, including a heavy chest piece, armbands, wrist gauntlets, and shin guards
  - patterned breeches or skirt in muted reds, teals, and gold filigree
  - right hand (viewer's left) raised high, gripping a straight, silver-bladed sword with a golden hilt
  - "when transformed/at peace: kind, benevolent, wise expression with frosty Tibetan imagery - lotuses, deities, and rainbows in the air around him"

# Easter egg statuette form (for hiding in scenes before the climax):
easter_egg:
  - tiny frozen statuette, no more than 6 inches tall
  - same visual features as full form but miniaturized and frozen/inanimate
  - appears as a decorative figurine, NOT alive - completely still and statue-like
  - crimson red with gold and turquoise details, tiny sword raised
  - should be tucked in logical places - behind books, on shelf corners, behind chair legs, on mantels
  - in living room scenes, appears as an ornament hanging on the Christmas tree
  - subtle enough to miss on first glance, but clearly him if you look closely
